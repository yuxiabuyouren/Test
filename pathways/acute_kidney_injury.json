For people with suspected sepsis take blood cultures before antibiotics are given. If meningococcal disease is specifically suspected (fever and purpuric rash) give appropriate doses of parenteral benzyl penicillin in community settings and intravenous ceftriaxone in hospital settings. For all people with suspected sepsis where the source of infection is clear use existing local antimicrobial guidance.For people aged up to 17 years (except neonates) with suspected community acquired sepsis of any cause give ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once a day with a maximum dose of 4g daily at any age. For people aged up to 17 years with suspected sepsis who are already in hospital, or who are known to have previously been infected with or colonised with ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria, consult local guidelines for choice of antibiotic.Follow NICE s recommendations on antimicrobial stewardship when prescribing and using antibiotics to treat people with suspected or confirmed sepsis.Diagnostic testingThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on procalcitonin testing for diagnosing and monitoring sepsis.The procalcitonin tests (ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay, BRAHMS PCT Sensitive Kryptor assay, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT assay and VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay) show promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption in the NHS. Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend. Do not use starch-based solutions or hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation for people with sepsis.Consider human albumin solution 4\u20135% for fluid resuscitation only in patients with sepsis and shock.If children and young people up to 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes.

For people with suspected sepsis take blood cultures before antibiotics are given. If meningococcal disease is specifically suspected (fever and purpuric rash) give appropriate doses of parenteral benzyl penicillin in community settings and intravenous ceftriaxone in hospital settings. For all people with suspected sepsis where the source of infection is clear use existing local antimicrobial guidance.For people aged up to 17 years (except neonates) with suspected community acquired sepsis of any cause give ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once a day with a maximum dose of 4g daily at any age. For people aged up to 17 years with suspected sepsis who are already in hospital, or who are known to have previously been infected with or colonised with ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria, consult local guidelines for choice of antibiotic.For children younger than 3 months, give an additional antibiotic active against listeria (for example, ampicillin or amoxicillin). Treat neonates presenting in hospital in their first 72 hours with suspected sepsis with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. Treat neonates who are more than 40 weeks corrected gestational age who present with community acquired sepsis with ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg unless already receiving an intravenous calcium infusion at the time. If 40 weeks corrected gestational age or below or receiving an intravenous calcium infusion use cefotaxime 50 mg/kg every 6 to 12 hours, depending on the age of the neonate.Follow NICE s recommendations on antimicrobial stewardship when prescribing and using antibiotics to treat people with suspected or confirmed sepsis.Diagnostic testingThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on procalcitonin testing for diagnosing and monitoring sepsis.The procalcitonin tests (ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay, BRAHMS PCT Sensitive Kryptor assay, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT assay and VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay) show promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption in the NHS. Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend. Do not use starch-based solutions or hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation for people with sepsis.Consider human albumin solution 4\u20135% for fluid resuscitation only in patients with sepsis and shock.If children and young people up to 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes. Take into account pre-existing conditions (for example, cardiac disease or kidney disease), because smaller fluid volumes may be needed.Use a pump, or syringe if no pump is available, to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to children under 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form.If neonates need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids (normal saline) that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 10\u201320 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes.subhead:OxygenOxygen should be given to children with suspected sepsis who have signs of shock or oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 92% when breathing air.

The evidence is limited but suggests that in selected cases, Memokath-051 is effective at relieving ureteric obstruction and improving quality of life. When inserted by trained clinicians (see section 4.8) and in appropriate patients (see below), Memokath-051 is associated with equivalent success rates and a better patient experience compared with double-J stents. Using Memokath-051 may also reduce the number of stent replacements needed compared with using double-J stents.Memokath-051 stents should be considered as an option in patients with: malignant ureteric obstruction and anticipated medium- or long-term survival after adjunctive therapy benign ureteric obstruction who cannot have or do not want reconstructive surgery or ureteric obstruction of any kind who cannot have or do not want a double-J stent, or for whom repeat procedures are a particularly high risk.The cost consequences of adopting Memokath-051 are uncertain. However, when used in appropriate patients and by clinicians trained in its use, it may be cost neutral or cost saving compared with standard treatment. Potential cost savings mainly come from fewer repeat procedures with Memokath-051.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

SecurAcath is easy to insert, well tolerated, associated with a low incidence of catheter-related complications and does not usually need removing while the catheter is in place.SecurAcath should be considered for any PICC with an anticipated medium- to long-term dwell time (15 days or more).Cost modelling shows that SecurAcath is cost saving compared with adhesive securement devices if the PICC remains in place for 15 days or longer. Estimated cost savings range from \u00a39 to \u00a395 per patient for dwell times of 25 days and 120 days, respectively. Cost savings result from shorter maintenance times and less need for device replacement with SecurAcath. Annual savings across the NHS from using SecurAcath are estimated to be around \u00a31 million.subhead:The 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sitesThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites.The case for adopting the 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites is supported by the evidence. This technology allows observation, and provides antiseptic coverage, of the catheter insertion site. It reduces catheter-related bloodstream infections and local site infections compared with semipermeable transparent (standard) dressings. It can be used with existing care bundles.The 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing should be considered for use in critically ill adults who need a central venous or arterial catheter in intensive care or high dependency units.The estimated cost saving from using a 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing (Tegaderm CHG) instead of a standard transparent semipermeable dressing is \u00a373 per patient. This estimate is based on a baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate of 1.48 per 1000 catheter days. Tegaderm CHG is estimated to be cost neutral when the baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate is 0.24 per 1000 catheter days, and cost incurring when the baseline rate falls below that figure. Estimates of the population for Tegaderm CHG based on adult intensive care episodes needing a central venous or arterial catheter vary from around 88,000 to 226,000 depending on whether episodes longer than 48 hours, or all episodes, are used. Based on these estimates, if the use of Tegaderm CHG became standard practice, it has the potential to save the NHS in England between \u00a34.2 million and \u00a310.8 million each year, assuming the baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate is 1.48 per 1000 catheter days.subhead:Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System for placing peripherally inserted central cathetersThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters.The case for adopting the Sherlock 3CG TCS for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters is supported by the evidence. The technology usually avoids the need for a confirmatory chest X-ray in patients who would otherwise have blind insertion, minimising the delay before the catheter can be used for infusion. Using the technology increases staff confidence during catheter insertion.The Sherlock 3CG TCS should be considered as an option for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters in adults. For patients whose electrocardiogram does not show a P wave (for example, patients with atrial fibrillation), a chest X-ray will still be needed to confirm tip location of the peripherally inserted central catheter.The cost of using the Sherlock 3CG TCS is similar to that of blind insertion and subsequent chest X-ray in adults who need a peripherally inserted central catheter in a non-intensive care setting. When the Sherlock 3CG TCS is used instead of fluoroscopy, the estimated cost saving is \u00a3106 per patient. In an intensive care setting, where the rate of misplacement with blind insertion is generally higher, there is an estimated cost saving of \u00a341 per patient per use of the Sherlock 3CG TCS and a confirmatory chest X-ray compared with using blind insertion and chest X-ray. All these cost savings are subject to some uncertainty and need to be considered in the context of the clinical benefits.subhead:Medtech innovation briefingsNICE has published medtech innovation briefings on: Biopatch for venous or arterial catheter sites AccuVein AV400 for vein visualisation.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
