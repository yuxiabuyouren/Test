This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical.  Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be: planned within a time frame agreed with the person or patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
