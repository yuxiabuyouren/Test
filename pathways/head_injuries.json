If there is suspicion of vascular injury (for example, vertebral malalignment, a fracture involving the foramina transversaria or lateral processes, or a posterior circulation syndrome), CT or MRI angiography of the neck vessels may be performed to evaluate for this.Be aware that MRI may add important information about soft tissue injuries associated with bony injuries demonstrated by X-ray and/or CT. MRI has a role in the assessment of ligamentous and disc injuries suggested by X-ray, CT or clinical findings. In CT, routinely review on  bone windows  the occipital condyle region for patients who have sustained a head injury. Reconstruction of standard head images onto a high-resolution bony algorithm is readily achieved with modern CT scanners. In patients who have sustained high-energy trauma or are showing signs of lower cranial nerve palsy, pay particular attention to the region of the foramen magnum.

The possibility of occult extracranial injuries should be considered for adults with multiple injuries, and they should not be transferred to a service that is unable to deal with other aspects of trauma. There should be a designated consultant in the referring hospital with responsibility for establishing arrangements for the transfer of patients with head injuries to a neuroscience unit and another consultant at the neuroscience unit with responsibility for establishing arrangements for communication with referring hospitals and for receipt of patients transferred. Patients with head injuries requiring emergency transfer to a neuroscience unit should be accompanied by a doctor with appropriate training and experience in the transfer of patients with acute brain injury. They should be familiar with the pathophysiology of head injury, the drugs and equipment they will use and working in the confines of an ambulance (or helicopter if appropriate).
