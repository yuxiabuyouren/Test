NICE has written information for the public on ticagrelor.PrasugrelThe following recommendation is from NICE technology appraisal guidance on prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes.Prasugrel 10 mg in combination with aspirin is recommended as an option within its marketing authorisation, that is, for preventing atherothrombotic events in adults with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI) having primary or delayed PCI.NICE has written information for the public on prasugrel.CangrelorThe NICE technology appraisal of cangrelor for reducing atherothrombotic events in people undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or awaiting surgery requiring interruption of anti-platelet therapy was terminated because no evidence submission was received from The Medicines Company for the technology. Therefore NICE is unable to make a recommendation about the use in the NHS of cangrelor for reducing atherothrombotic events in people undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or awaiting surgery requiring interruption of anti-platelet therapy.NICE has published an evidence summary on coronary revascularisation: cangrelor.subhead:Anti-thrombin agentsHeparinOffer unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin to people with acute STEMI who are undergoing primary PCI and have been treated with prasugrel or ticagrelor.BivalirudinThe following recommendation is from NICE technology appraisal guidance on bivalirudin for the treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.Bivalirudin in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for the treatment of adults with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. NICE has written information for the public on bivalirudin.subhead:StentsCoronary artery stentsThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on the use of coronary artery stents.Stents should be used routinely where PCI is the clinically appropriate procedure for patients with either stable or unstable angina or with acute myocardial infarction.This guidance specifically relates to the present clinical indications for PCI and excludes conditions (such as many cases of stable angina) that are adequately managed with standard drug therapy.NICE has written information for the public on coronary artery stents.Drug-eluting stents The following recommendation is from NICE technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.Drug-eluting stents are recommended for use in PCI for the treatment of coronary artery disease, within their instructions for use, only if:  the target artery to be treated has less than a 3-mm calibre or the lesion is longer than 15 mm, and  the price difference between drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents is no more than \u00a3300.NICE has written information for the public on drug-eluting stents.Bioresorbable stentsNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on bioresorbable stent implantation for treating coronary artery disease with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on: optical coherence tomography to guide percutaneous coronary intervention with special arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit thrombin injections for pseudoaneurysms with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance.subhead:Medtech innovation briefingsNICE has published medtech innovation briefings on: Impella 2.5 for haemodynamic support during high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions the PressureWire fractional flow reserve measurement system for coronary artery disease.subhead:People who have previously had PCI SeQuent Please balloon catheter for in-stent coronary restenosis The following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on SeQuent Please balloon catheter for in-stent coronary restenosis. The case for adopting SeQuent Please balloon catheter in the NHS, when used as described below, is supported by the evidence. The need for subsequent re-intervention for coronary stenosis is reduced as is the duration of clopidogrel therapy, compared with paclitaxel-eluting stent. SeQuent Please balloon catheter is associated with a cost saving of \u00a3467 per patient compared with paclitaxel-eluting stent.SeQuent Please balloon catheter should be considered for use in patients with in-stent restenosis in bare metal coronary artery stents. SeQuent Please balloon catheter can also be considered as an option for patients with in-stent restenosis in any type of coronary artery stent if: there are clinical reasons to minimise the duration of clopidogrel treatment (for example, there is concern about an increased risk of bleeding or there is the need for surgical intervention) or placement of further stents is not technically possible.Further research is recommended in a UK setting to compare the outcomes of patients treated with SeQuent Please balloon catheter with the outcomes of patients treated with other types of drug-eluting balloon catheter and stent. This research should report long-term outcomes (for example, after 3 years), including clinical outcomes and details of further revascularisation required for subsequent restenosis. Research should investigate the use of SeQuent Please balloon catheter for restenosis in drug-eluting coronary artery stents and in de novo coronary stenosis where stenting is either technically difficult or is associated with an increased risk of complications. If research shows that SeQuent Please balloon catheter reduces the rate of restenosis in patients with drug-eluting stents or in native coronary arteries, compared with other technologies, then the number of patients for whom it might be suitable would increase significantly.

The guidance does not compare hospital and pre-hospital models of delivering thrombolysis.It is recommended that, in hospital, the choice of thrombolytic drug (alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase or tenecteplase) should take account of: the likely balance of benefit and harm (for example, stroke) to which each of the thrombolytic agents would expose the individual patient current UK clinical practice, in which it is accepted that patients who have previously received streptokinase should not be treated with it again the hospital s arrangements for reducing delays in the administration of thrombolysis.Where pre-hospital delivery of thrombolytic drugs is considered a beneficial approach as part of an emergency-care pathway for acute myocardial infarction (for example, because of population geography or the accessibility of acute hospital facilities), the practicalities of administering thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings mean that the bolus drugs (reteplase or tenecteplase) are recommended as the preferred option.NICE has written information for the public on thrombolytic drugs.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
