Please note that because of the reduction in prices for oral bisphosphonates over the last few years, the absolute risk level at which these drugs are cost-effective is now very low. The absolute risk level at which oral bisphosphonates are recommended as treatment options in this guidance are therefore not clinical intervention thresholds. In February 2018, NICE issued a clarification statement on implementation of this appraisal.Oral bisphosphonates (alendronic acid, ibandronic acid and risedronate sodium) are recommended as options for treating osteoporosis in adults only if: the person is eligible for risk assessment as defined in when to assess a person depending on age and sex and the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 1%.Intravenous bisphosphonates (ibandronic acid and zoledronic acid) are recommended as options for treating osteoporosis in adults only if: the person is eligible for risk assessment as defined in when to assess a person depending on age and sex and the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 10% or the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 1% and the person has difficulty taking oral bisphosphonates (alendronic acid, ibandronic acid or risedronate sodium) or these drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated.Estimate the 10-year probability of fragility fracture using the FRAX or QFracture risk tools, in line with recommendations on estimating absolute risk.The choice of treatment should be made on an individual basis after discussion between the responsible clinician and the patient, or their carers, about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments available. If several generic products are available, start treatment with the least expensive formulation, taking into account administration costs, the dose needed and the cost per dose.These recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with alendronic acid, ibandronic acid, risedronate sodium and zoledronic acid that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. Adults having treatment outside these recommendations may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.See why we made the recommendations on bisphosphonates.NICE has published information for the public explaining its guidance on bisphosphonates.subhead:Discuss stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 3 yearsTell a person who has been taking bisphosphonate for osteoporosis for at least 3 years that there is no consistent evidence of: further benefit from continuing bisphosphonate for another 3 years harms from stopping bisphosphonate after 3 years of treatment.Discuss stopping bisphosphonate after 3 years and include patient choice, fracture risk and life expectancy in the discussion.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Starting drug treatment3Adverse effects and adherence to treatment4Long-term follow-upSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Ensure the care home environment and layout are used in a way that encourages social interaction, activity and peer support, as well as providing privacy and personal space.Ensure people are physically comfortable, for example by allowing them control over the heating in their rooms.Encourage social contact and provide opportunities for education, entertainment and meaningful occupation by:  making it easier for people to communicate and interact with others, for example by reducing background noise, providing face-to-face contact with other people, using accessible signage and lighting  using a range of technologies such as IT platforms and Wi-Fi, hearing loops and TV listeners involving the wider community in the life of the care home through befriending schemes and intergenerational projects offering opportunities for movement.
