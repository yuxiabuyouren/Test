If the child s length or height centile is below the range predicted from parental heights (more than 2 centile spaces below the mid-parental centile) be aware this could suggest undernutrition or a primary growth disorder.If there is concern about faltering growth or linear growth in a child over 2 years of age, determine the BMI centile: using the UK WHO centiles and the accompanying BMI centile  look-up chart  or by calculating the BMI (weight in kg/height in metres squared) and plotting this on the BMI centile chart.Then: if the BMI is below the 2nd centile, be aware this may reflect either undernutrition or a small build if the BMI is below the 0.4th centile, this suggests probable undernutrition that needs assessment and intervention.Record all growth measurements in the parent or carer-held Personal Child Health Record.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Be aware that the following factors may be associated with faltering growth: preterm birth neurodevelopmental concerns maternal postnatal depression or anxiety.Recognise that in faltering growth: a range of factors may contribute to the problem, and it may not be possible to identify a clear cause there may be difficulties in the interaction between an infant or child and the parents or carers that may contribute to the problem, but this may not be the primary cause.Based on the feeding history and any direct observation of feeding, consider whether any of the following are contributing to faltering growth in milk-fed infants: ineffective suckling in breastfed infants ineffective bottle feeding feeding patterns or routines being used the feeding environment feeding aversion parent/carer-infant interactions how parents or carers respond to the infant s feeding cues physical disorders that affect feeding.Based on the feeding history and any direct observation of mealtimes, consider whether any of the following are contributing to faltering growth: mealtime arrangements and practices types of foods offered food aversion and avoidance parent/carer-child interactions, for example responding to the child s mealtime cues appetite, for example a lack of interest in eating physical disorders that affect feeding.Consider asking the parents or carers of infants and children with faltering growth to keep a diary recording food intake (types and amounts) and mealtime issues (for example, settings, behaviour) to help inform management strategies and assess progress.Be aware that investigations (other than those recommended above) are unlikely to reveal an underlying disorder in a child with faltering growth who appears well with no other clinical concerns.If a child with faltering growth develops new clinical symptoms or signs after the initial assessment, reconsider whether investigations are needed.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This plan could include: assessments or investigations interventions clinical and growth monitoring when reassessment to review progress and achievement of growth goals should happen.Provide feeding support (see what NICE says on postnatal care) if there is concern about faltering growth in the first weeks of life. Consider whether such feeding support might be helpful in older milk-fed infants, including those having complementary solid foods.Be aware that while supplementary feeding with infant formula may increase weight gain in a breastfed infant if there is concern about faltering growth, it often results in cessation of breastfeeding.If supplementation with an infant formula is given to a breastfed infant because of concern about faltering growth after the early days of life: support the mother to continue breastfeeding advise expressing breast milk to promote milk supply and feed the infant with any available breast milk before giving any infant formula.When there are concerns about faltering growth, discuss the following, as individually appropriate, with the infant s or child s parents or carers: encouraging relaxed and enjoyable feeding and mealtimes eating together as a family or with other children encouraging young children to feed themselves allowing young children to be  messy  with their food making sure feeds and mealtimes are not too brief or too long setting reasonable boundaries for mealtime behaviour while avoiding punitive approaches  avoiding coercive feeding establishing regular eating schedules (for example 3 meals and 2 snacks in a day).If necessary, based on the assessment, advise on food choices for infants and children that: are appropriate to the child s developmental stage in terms of quantity, type and food texture optimise energy and nutrient density.In infants or children who need a further increase in the nutrient density of their diet beyond that achieved through advice on food choices, consider: short-term dietary fortification using energy-dense foods referral to a paediatric dietitian.Advise the parents or carers of infants or children with faltering growth that drinking too many energy-dense drinks, including milk, can reduce a child s appetite for other foods.Consider a trial of an oral liquid nutritional supplement for infants or children with continuing faltering growth despite other interventions (see recommendations above).Regularly reassess infants and children receiving an oral nutritional supplement for faltering growth to decide if it should be continued.
