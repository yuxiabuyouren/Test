NICE has produced recommendations on surgical management of otitis media with effusion in children.Be aware that some symptoms of a non-IgE-mediated cows  milk protein allergy can be similar to the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, especially in infants with atopic symptoms, signs and/or a family history. If a non-IgE-mediated cows  milk protein allergy is suspected, see NICE s recommendations on food allergy in under 19s.When deciding whether to investigate or treat, take into account that the following are associated with an increased prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: premature birth parental history of heartburn or acid regurgitation obesity hiatus hernia history of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (repaired) history of congenital oesophageal atresia (repaired) a neurodisability.Gastro-oesophageal reflux only rarely causes episodes of apnoea or apparent life-threatening events, but consider referral for specialist investigations if it is suspected as a possible factor following a general paediatric assessment. Do not offer an upper gastrointestinal contrast study to diagnose or assess the severity of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants.Perform an urgent (same day) upper gastrointestinal contrast study for infants with unexplained bile-stained vomiting.

Raising the head of the bed and having a main meal well before going to bed may help some people. subhead:Providing informationProvide people with access to educational materials to support the care they receive. subhead:Psychological therapiesRecognise that psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and psychotherapy, may reduce dyspeptic symptoms in the short term in individual people. subhead:Drug therapyEncourage people who need long-term management of dyspepsia symptoms to reduce their use of prescribed medication stepwise: by using the effective lowest dose, by trying  as-needed  use when appropriate, and by returning to self-treatment with antacid and/or alginate therapy (unless there is an underlying condition or comedication that needs continuing treatment). Avoid long-term, frequent-dose, continuous antacid therapy (it only relieves symptoms in the short term rather than preventing them).See what NICE says on medicines optimisation.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Dyspepsia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in adults1Advice to support self-managementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
