If this treatment does not control the atopic eczema, review the diagnosis and refer for specialist dermatological advice. Do not use potent topical corticosteroids on the face and neck.Do not use potent topical corticosteroids in children under 12 months without specialist dermatological supervision.

Topical tacrolimus is recommended, within its licensed indications, as an option for the second-line treatment of moderate to severe atopic eczema in adults and children aged 2 years and older that has not been controlled by topical corticosteroids, where there is a serious risk of important adverse effects from further topical corticosteroid use, particularly irreversible skin atrophy.Pimecrolimus is recommended, within its licensed indications, as an option for the second-line treatment of moderate atopic eczema on the face and neck in children aged 2 to 16 years that has not been controlled by topical corticosteroids, where there is a serious risk of important adverse effects from further topical corticosteroid use, particularly irreversible skin atrophy.For the purposes of this guidance, atopic eczema that has not been controlled by topical corticosteroids refers to disease that has not shown a satisfactory clinical response to adequate use of the maximum strength and potency that is appropriate for the patient s age and the area being treated.It is recommended that treatment with tacrolimus or pimecrolimus be initiated only by physicians (including general practitioners) with a special interest and experience in dermatology, and only after careful discussion with the patient about the potential risks and benefits of all appropriate second-line treatment options.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.subhead:Topical calcineurin inhibitors for facial atopic eczema Consider stepping up treatment to topical calcineurin inhibitors for facial atopic eczema in children that requires long-term or frequent use of mild topical corticosteroids. subhead:ApplicationExplain that topical calcineurin inhibitors should only be applied to areas of active atopic eczema, which may include areas of broken skin.Do not use topical calcineurin inhibitors under occlusion (bandages and dressings) for treating atopic eczema in children without specialist dermatological advice.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The ImmunoCAP ISAC\u00a0112 shows promise and further research is recommended on the clinical effectiveness of using it in people with allergy that is difficult to diagnose (see the section\u00a0on recommendations for further research of the NICE guidance). Microtest is a new technology and further research by the company to show its clinical effectiveness is encouraged.An allergy healthcare professional with appropriate expertise is needed to ensure the results of multiplex allergen tests are interpreted correctly.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Assessment at diagnosis5Referral for specialist dermatological advice6Specialist allergy investigationSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
