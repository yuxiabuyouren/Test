Consideration should be given to training peer mentors and health champions from the prison and immigration removal centre populations to support this work.The NHS lead for hepatitis treatment (for example, a community hepatitis nurse) should develop a care pathway for prisoners and immigration detainees with diagnosed hepatitis B or C.

Once a prisoner has started treatment, it may be helpful to put them on medical hold to ensure continuity of care (which might be compromised by transfer between prisons).

Ensure training programme content is accurate and up-to-date, reflecting advances in testing, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B and C. Think about linking awareness-raising activities with existing education for health and social care professionals. This could take a variety of forms, for example, it could be offered as a taught or an electronic learning module. Local education and training boards in each region should ensure that people involved in testing for hepatitis B and C take part in a programme of continuing professional development.

This includes the belief that treatments are not effective, or that treatment is not needed until the illness is advanced. Campaigns should also make it clear that testing and treatment is confidential and address the stigma surrounding these infections. Ensure messages to raise awareness of hepatitis B and C are coordinated and integrated within other health promotion campaigns, where possible or appropriate. Ensure national and local awareness-raising activities take into account age, culture and religious beliefs of groups at increased risk, and their needs in relation to format and the language used.

VTq is as accurate as transient elastography in diagnosing and staging liver fibrosis, and may offer other benefits in terms of imaging the liver and sampling selected areas to assess fibrosis and identify associated pathologies. By avoiding liver biopsies, it may also benefit people whose liver fibrosis needs monitoring. Cost savings through adopting VTq will be greater in hospitals in which liver biopsy is the primary method for diagnosing and monitoring liver fibrosis. VTq should be considered as an option for people with chronic hepatitis B or C who need assessment of liver fibrosis.Cost modelling suggests that using VTq is cost saving compared with transient elastography and liver biopsy, whether or not a compatible Siemens ultrasound machine needs to be purchased. Compared with transient elastography, the estimated overall cost saving for VTq is around \u00a353 per person. This saving assumes that 10% of the ultrasound machine capacity would be used for VTq measurements, leaving 90% to be applied to other uses.
