The expected benefits and risks of each treatment option. That new varicose veins may develop after treatment. That they may need more than 1 session of treatment.

If endothermal ablation is unsuitable, offer ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy.  If ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is unsuitable, offer surgery. If incompetent varicose tributaries are to be treated, consider treating them at the same time. If offering compression bandaging or hosiery for use after interventional treatment, do not use for more than 7 days.See what NICE says on preoperative tests.Compression hosieryOffer compression hosiery only if interventional treatment is unsuitable.
