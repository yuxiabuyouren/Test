This could include providing access to trained interpreters or offering one-to-one sessions. It could also include introducing special facilities for those with physical and sensory disabilities and assistance for those with learning disabilities. Encourage and help young mothers (including teenage mothers) to use contraceptive services, for example, by working with family nurse partnerships or children s centres. Offer support and referral to specialist services (including counselling) to those who may need it. For example, young people who misuse drugs or alcohol and those who may have been (or who may be at risk of being) sexually exploited or trafficked may need such support. The same is true of those who have been the victim of sexual violence. Provide outreach contraceptive services that offer information, advice, and the full range of options. This includes provision for those living in rural areas who cannot reach existing clinics and services. Offer culturally appropriate, confidential, non-judgmental, empathic advice and support tailored to the needs of the young person. Tailored support might involve, for example, providing relevant information in small manageable amounts, checking whether it has been understood, and reiterating and revising information if required.

Reassure young people that they will not be discussed with others without their explicit consent. Explain that sharing information with another professional may be necessary if there are concerns, for example to protect a young person from possible harm or abuse.
