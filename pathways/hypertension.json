If pulse irregularity is present, measure blood pressure manually using direct auscultation over the brachial artery. Healthcare providers must ensure that devices for measuring blood pressure are properly validated, maintained and regularly recalibrated according to manufacturers  instructions. When measuring blood pressure in the clinic or in the home, standardise the environment and provide a relaxed, temperate setting, with the person quiet and seated, and their arm outstretched and supported. If using an automated blood pressure monitoring device, ensure that the device is validated and an appropriate cuff size for the person s arm is used. (A list of validated blood pressure monitoring devices is available on the British Hypertension Society s website. The British Hypertension Society is an independent reviewer of published work. This does not imply any endorsement by NICE.)subhead:Postural hypotensionIn people with symptoms of postural hypotension (falls or postural dizziness): measure blood pressure with the person either supine or seated measure blood pressure again with the person standing for at least 1 minute prior to measurement.If the systolic blood pressure falls by 20 mmHg or more when the person is standing: review medication measure subsequent blood pressures with the person standing consider referral to specialist care if symptoms of postural hypotension persist. subhead:Measuring the clinic blood pressureWhen considering a diagnosis of hypertension, measure blood pressure in both arms. If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg, repeat the measurements. If the difference in readings between arms remains more than 20 mmHg on the second measurement, measure subsequent blood pressures in the arm with the higher reading. If blood pressure measured in the clinic is 140/90 mmHg or higher: Take a second measurement during the consultation. If the second measurement is substantially different from the first, take a third measurement.Record the lower of the last two measurements as the clinic blood pressure.subhead:WatchBP Home AThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on WatchBP Home A for opportunistically detecting atrial fibrillation during diagnosis and monitoring of hypertension.The case for adopting WatchBP Home A in the NHS, for opportunistically detecting asymptomatic atrial fibrillation during the measurement of blood pressure by primary care professionals, is supported by the evidence. The available evidence suggests that the device reliably detects atrial fibrillation and may increase the rate of detection when used in primary care. This would allow prophylactic treatment to be given to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation-related stroke. WatchBP Home A should be considered for use in people with suspected hypertension and those being screened or monitored for hypertension, in primary care.People suspected of having atrial fibrillation after use of WatchBP Home A should have an electrocardiogram (ECG) in line with NICE s recommendations on atrial fibrillation.Use of WatchBP Home A in primary care is associated with estimated overall cost savings per person measured, ranging from \u00a32.98 for those aged between 65 and 74 years to \u00a34.26 for those aged 75 years and over. There is uncertainty about the costs and benefits for people younger than 65, however it is plausible that using the device in this group will benefit patients and the healthcare system. Cost analyses did not support the use of the device by patients in their homes.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If the person has severe hypertension, consider starting antihypertensive drug treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM.While waiting for confirmation of a diagnosis of hypertension, carry out investigations for target organ damage (such as left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease and hypertensive retinopathy) and a formal assessment of cardiovascular risk using a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (see assessing cardiovascular risk and target organ damage). When using ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, ensure that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person s usual waking hours (for example, between 08:00 and 22:00). Use the average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person s usual waking hours to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension. When using HBPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, ensure that: for each blood pressure recording, two consecutive measurements are taken, at least 1 minute apart and with the person seated and blood pressure is recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening and  blood pressure recording continues for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days.Discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value of all the remaining measurements to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension.Refer the person to specialist care the same day if they have: accelerated hypertension, that is, blood pressure usually higher than 180/110 mmHg with signs of papilloedema and/or retinal haemorrhage or suspected phaeochromocytoma (labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis).
