using during your treatment with adalimumab, especially:", "description": "title:drug treatment: biological therapyhead:Drug treatment: biological therapysubhead:Infliximab and adalimumabWhen a person with Crohn s disease is starting infliximab or adalimumab (in line with the NICE technology appraisal guidance recommendations below), discuss options of:  monotherapy with one of these drugs or combined therapy (either infliximab or adalimumab, combined with an immunosuppressant)and tell the person there is uncertainty about the comparative effectiveness and long-term adverse effects of monotherapy and combined therapy.The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn s disease.Infliximab and adalimumab, within their licensed indications, are recommended as treatment options for adults with severe active Crohn s disease (see below) whose disease has not responded to conventional therapy (including immunosuppressive and/or corticosteroid treatments), or who are intolerant of or have contraindications to conventional therapy. Infliximab or adalimumab should be given as a planned course of treatment until treatment failure (including the need for surgery), or until 12 months after the start of treatment, whichever is shorter. People should then have their disease reassessed (see below) to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate.Treatment as described above should normally be started with the less expensive drug (taking into account drug administration costs, required dose and product price per dose). This may need to be varied for individual patients because of differences in the method of administration and treatment schedules. Infliximab, within its licensed indication, is recommended as a treatment option for people with active fistulising Crohn s disease whose disease has not responded to conventional therapy (including antibiotics, drainage and immunosuppressive treatments), or who are intolerant of or have contraindications to conventional therapy. Infliximab should be given as a planned course of treatment until treatment failure (including the need for surgery) or until 12 months after the start of treatment, whichever is shorter. People should then have their disease reassessed (see below) to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate.Treatment with infliximab or adalimumab (see above) should only be continued if there is clear evidence of ongoing active disease as determined by clinical symptoms, biological markers and investigation, including endoscopy if necessary. Specialists should discuss the risks and benefits of continued treatment with patients and consider a trial withdrawal from treatment for all patients who are in stable clinical remission. People who continue treatment with infliximab or adalimumab should have their disease reassessed at least every 12 months to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate. People whose disease relapses after treatment is stopped should have the option to start treatment again. Infliximab, within its licensed indication, is recommended for the treatment of people aged 6\u201317 years with severe active Crohn s disease whose disease has not responded to conventional therapy (including corticosteroids, immunomodulators and primary nutrition therapy), or who are intolerant of or have contraindications to conventional therapy. The need to continue treatment should be reviewed at least every 12 months. For the purposes of this guidance, severe active Crohn s disease is defined as very poor general health and one or more symptoms such as weight loss, fever, severe abdominal pain and usually frequent (3\u20134 or more) diarrhoeal stools daily. People with severe active Crohn s disease may or may not develop new fistulae or have extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease. This clinical definition normally, but not exclusively, corresponds to a Crohn s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 300 or more, or a Harvey-Bradshaw score of 8 to 9 or above. When using the CDAI and Harvey-Bradshaw Index, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect the scores and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.Treatment with infliximab or adalimumab should only be started and reviewed by clinicians with experience of TNF inhibitors and of managing Crohn s disease. NICE has written information for the public on infliximab and adalimumab.subhead:Therapeutic monitoring of TNF-alpha inhibitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on therapeutic monitoring of TNF-alpha inhibitors in Crohn s disease (LISA-TRACKER ELISA kits, IDKmonitor ELISA kits, and Promonitor ELISA kits).The LISA-TRACKER, IDKmonitor and Promonitor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits show promise for therapeutic monitoring of TNF-alpha inhibitors in people with Crohn s disease but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption across the NHS.Laboratories currently using LISA-TRACKER, IDKmonitor and Promonitor ELISA kits for therapeutic monitoring of TNF-alpha inhibitors in people with Crohn s disease whose disease loses response to TNF-alpha inhibitors should: have specialist expertise in immunoassay analysis, including an understanding of the technical factors that may affect the results of the ELISA kits work closely with the treating or referring clinician, in a network, to ensure appropriate use of the tests and interpretation of the results work with clinicians to collect data through a prospective study, for local audit, or for submission to an existing registry. (The IBD Registry is being adapted to receive data on TNF-alpha inhibitor levels and antibodies against TNF-alpha inhibitors. When this facility is available, all data should be entered onto the database; see section 7.2 of the guidance).Further research is recommended on the clinical and cost effectiveness of using LISA-TRACKER, IDKmonitor and Promonitor ELISA kits for therapeutic monitoring of TNF-alpha inhibitors in people with Crohn s disease whose disease responds to treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors (see section 7.3 of the guidance).subhead:UstekinumabThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on ustekinumab for moderately to severely active Crohn s disease after previous treatment.Ustekinumab is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating moderately to severely active Crohn s disease, that is, for adults who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a TNF-alpha inhibitor or have medical contraindications to such therapies.The choice of treatment between ustekinumab or another biological therapy should be made on an individual basis after discussion between the patient and their clinician about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments available. If more than 1 treatment is suitable, the least expensive should be chosen (taking into account administration costs, dosage and price per dose).Ustekinumab should be given until treatment failure (including the need for surgery) or until 12 months after the start of treatment, whichever is shorter. People should then have their disease reassessed in accordance with NICE s recommendations for infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn s disease to see whether treatment should continue.NICE has written information for the public on ustekinumab.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on RIDASCREEN tests for monitoring infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease.subhead:VedolizumabThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on vedolizumab for treating moderately to severely active Crohn s disease after prior therapy.Vedolizumab is recommended as an option for treating moderately to severely active Crohn s disease only if: a TNF-alpha inhibitor has failed (that is, the disease has responded inadequately or has lost response to treatment) or  a TNF-alpha inhibitor cannot be tolerated or is contraindicated.Vedolizumab is recommended only if the company provides it with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.Vedolizumab should be given as a planned course of treatment until it stops working or surgery is needed, or until 12 months after the start of treatment, whichever is shorter. At 12 months, people should be reassessed to determine whether treatment should continue. Treatment should only continue if there is clear evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. For people in complete remission at 12 months, consider stopping vedolizumab, resuming treatment if there is a relapse. People who continue vedolizumab should be reassessed at least every 12 months to decide whether continued treatment is justified.People whose treatment with vedolizumab is not recommended in this NICE guidance, but was started within the NHS before this guidance was published, should be able to continue treatment until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public on vedolizumab.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The choice of treatment between infliximab, adalimumab or golimumab should be made on an individual basis after discussion between the responsible clinician and the patient about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments available. This should take into consideration therapeutic need and whether or not the patient is likely to adhere to treatment. If more than 1 treatment is suitable, the least expensive should be chosen (taking into account administration costs, dosage and price per dose).Infliximab is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating severely active ulcerative colitis in children and young people aged 6\u201317 years whose disease has responded inadequately to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and mercaptopurine or azathioprine, or who cannot tolerate, or have medical contraindications for, such therapies.Infliximab, adalimumab or golimumab should be given as a planned course of treatment until treatment fails (including the need for surgery) or until 12 months after starting treatment, whichever is shorter. Specialists should then discuss the risks and benefits of continued treatment with the patient, and their parent or carer if appropriate: They should continue treatment only if there is clear evidence of response as determined by clinical symptoms, biological markers and investigation, including endoscopy if necessary. People who continue treatment should be reassessed at least every 12 months to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate. They should consider a trial withdrawal from treatment for all patients who are in stable clinical remission. People whose disease relapses after treatment is stopped should have the option to start treatment again.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab.subhead:VedolizumabThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on vedolizumab for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.Vedolizumab is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults only if the company provides vedolizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.Vedolizumab should be given until it stops working or surgery is needed. At 12 months after the start of treatment, people should be reassessed to see whether treatment should continue. Treatment should only continue if there is clear evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. For people in complete remission at 12 months, consider stopping vedolizumab, then resuming treatment if there is a relapse. People who continue vedolizumab should be reassessed at least every 12 months to see whether continued treatment is justified.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on vedolizumab.subhead:Budesonide multimatrixNICE has published an evidence summary on ulcerative colitis: budesonide multimatrix (Cortiment).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This practical resource is for primary care professionals (it is not formal NICE guidance).The recommendations in this guidance on diagnostic investigations refer to people whose condition is being managed in secondary care. Advise the patient that more than one investigation may be necessary to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Offer colonoscopy to patients without major comorbidity, to confirm a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected, perform a biopsy to obtain histological proof of diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated (for example, patients with a blood clotting disorder). Offer flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema for patients with major comorbidity. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected perform a biopsy unless it is contraindicated. Consider computed tomographic (CT) colonography as an alternative to colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema, if the local radiology service can demonstrate competency in this technique. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected on CT colonography, offer a colonoscopy with biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated.

Do not wait for the results before starting treatment.If using immunohistochemistry, follow the steps in table 1.Table 1 Steps in the immunohistochemistry testing strategyStep 1 Do an immunohistochemistry 4-panel test for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Step 2 If the MLH1 immunohistochemistry result is abnormal, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test.  If the MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 immunohistochemistry results are abnormal, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  If using microsatellite instability testing, follow the steps in table 2.Table 2 Steps in the microsatellite instability testing strategyStep 1 Do a microsatellite instability test. Step 2 If the microsatellite instability test result is positive, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  Healthcare professionals should ensure that people are informed of the possible implications of test results for both themselves and their relatives, and ensure that relevant support and information is available. Discussion of genetic testing should be done by a healthcare professional with appropriate training.Laboratories doing microsatellite instability testing or immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins should take part in a recognised external quality assurance programme.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1ColonoscopySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
