Develop, deliver and sustain national and local media campaigns to raise awareness of the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure. Campaign messages should:  Aim to make people aware of the need to think about their daily exposure to sunlight.  Target at-risk groups (see focus activities on at-risk groups) and be consistent (see supporting information for practitioners in the NICE guideline on sunlight exposure: risks and benefits). Address common misconceptions about keeping safe in the sun and the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure.  Present a balanced picture of the risks and benefits, explaining how to enjoy the sun safely. Emphasise how the risks and benefits will vary depending on the individual.  Relate to leisure activities and holidays as well as daily life. Campaigns should: Use different channels to communicate simple and more complex messages. For example, population-wide messages may focus on sun protection and enjoying the sun safely. More nuanced messages, such as the risk of over- or underexposure for subgroups and individuals, could be included in supporting resources such as leaflets, press statements and websites.  Be delivered in a way that meets the target audience s preferences. For example, via radio, social media, texts, posters or leaflets.  Be displayed at prominent locations. For example, airports, schools, pharmacies, travel vaccination clinics, leisure and sporting events, and on travel websites and in magazines. Be repeated over time and regularly altered to keep the audience s attention.  Be timed for maximum effect. For example, so they take place during spring and summer when the risk of sunburn is highest in the UK, or when people are more likely to travel abroad. Ensure that the format and content of national campaigns are developed and piloted with the target audience. If feasible, do the same for local activities and supporting resources. Ensure that campaigns tackle health inequalities by taking into account cultural, religious and social norms about sunlight exposure. Outline what different groups should do to minimise their risks and maximise their benefits and how this may vary on an individual basis. Messages should also be conveyed in languages spoken locally.Integrate and coordinate campaign messages with existing national and local health promotion programmes or services to keep costs as low as possible. (Examples of initiatives they could be integrated with include Sure Start, Change4Life and community pharmacy public health services.)

Follow the principles of behaviour change when conveying sunlight exposure messages (see what NICE says on behaviour change). This includes ensuring that messages: specify the recommended actions  explain the benefits of changing behaviour try to enhance people s belief in their ability to adopt the recommended actions. Use existing community health promotion programmes or services to raise awareness of the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure.

Follow the principles of behaviour change when conveying sunlight exposure messages (see what NICE says on behaviour change). This includes ensuring that messages: specify the recommended actions  explain the benefits of changing behaviour try to enhance people s belief in their ability to adopt the recommended actions. Use existing community health promotion programmes or services to raise awareness of the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure.

Develop, deliver and sustain national and local media campaigns to raise awareness of the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure. Campaign messages should:  Aim to make people aware of the need to think about their daily exposure to sunlight.  Target at-risk groups (see focus activities on at-risk groups) and be consistent (see supporting information for practitioners in the NICE guideline on sunlight exposure: risks and benefits). Address common misconceptions about keeping safe in the sun and the risks and benefits of sunlight exposure.  Present a balanced picture of the risks and benefits, explaining how to enjoy the sun safely. Emphasise how the risks and benefits will vary depending on the individual.  Relate to leisure activities and holidays as well as daily life. Campaigns should: Use different channels to communicate simple and more complex messages. For example, population-wide messages may focus on sun protection and enjoying the sun safely. More nuanced messages, such as the risk of over- or underexposure for subgroups and individuals, could be included in supporting resources such as leaflets, press statements and websites.  Be delivered in a way that meets the target audience s preferences. For example, via radio, social media, texts, posters or leaflets.  Be displayed at prominent locations. For example, airports, schools, pharmacies, travel vaccination clinics, leisure and sporting events, and on travel websites and in magazines. Be repeated over time and regularly altered to keep the audience s attention.  Be timed for maximum effect. For example, so they take place during spring and summer when the risk of sunburn is highest in the UK, or when people are more likely to travel abroad. Ensure that the format and content of national campaigns are developed and piloted with the target audience. If feasible, do the same for local activities and supporting resources. Ensure that campaigns tackle health inequalities by taking into account cultural, religious and social norms about sunlight exposure. Outline what different groups should do to minimise their risks and maximise their benefits and how this may vary on an individual basis. Messages should also be conveyed in languages spoken locally.Integrate and coordinate campaign messages with existing national and local health promotion programmes or services to keep costs as low as possible.

It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist.

Information should be appropriate to the patients  needs at that point in their diagnosis and treatment, and should be repeated over time. The information given must be specific to the histopathological type of lesion, type of treatment, local services and any choice within them, and should cover both physical and psychosocial issues. Those who are directly involved in treating patients should receive specific training in communication and breaking bad news. Patients should be invited to bring a companion with them to consultations. Each local hospital skin cancer multidisciplinary team and specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary team should have at least one skin cancer clinical nurse specialist who will play a leading role in supporting patients and carers. There should be equity of access to information and support regardless of where the care is delivered. All local hospital skin cancer multidisciplinary teams and specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary teams should have access to psychological support services for skin cancer patients.Follow the recommendations on follow-up in NICE s cancer service guideline on improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma, in particular the following 2 recommendations:  All patients should be given written instruction on how to obtain quick and easy access back to see a member of the local hospital skin cancer multidisciplinary team/specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary team when necessary. All patients should be given both oral and written information about the different types of skin cancer and instruction about self-surveillance.Carry out a holistic needs assessment to identify the psychosocial needs of people with melanoma and their needs for support and education about the likelihood of recurrence, metastatic spread, new primary lesions and the risk of melanoma in their family members.Follow NICE s recommendations on communication and patient-centred care in patient experience in adult NHS services.SourcesNG14CSG8", "drug": {}}}, {"category": "treatment", "id": "t9004", "name": "providing supportive and palliative care", "draggable": "true", "value": {"name": "providing supportive and palliative care", "type": "cancer ralated", "time": "", "intention": "", "description": "title:providing supportive and palliative carehead:Providing supportive and palliative careSupportive and palliative care of the patient should be provided by general and specialist palliative care providers in accordance with the NICE cancer service guideline on improving supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer.

The initial staging is based on the histopathological features reported by the pathologist looking at the microscopic sections of the tumour. The melanoma is staged as 0\u2013IIC, based on factors such as the thickness of the tumour and the presence or absence of ulceration. In many hospitals in the UK, this first step is followed by the option of a second, which is a sampling of the lymph nodes most likely to contain secondary melanoma cells (sentinel lymph node biopsy). If a sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed and microscopic disease is detected, the melanoma becomes stage III. If no microscopic disease is detected then the initial stage is used.subhead:Sentinel lymph node biopsyDo not offer imaging or sentinel lymph node biopsy to people who have stage IA melanoma or those who have stage IB melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm or less.Consider sentinel lymph node biopsy as a staging rather than a therapeutic procedure for people with stage IB\u2013IIC melanoma with a Breslow thickness of more than 1 mm, and give them detailed verbal and written information about the possible advantages and disadvantages, using the table below. (For help with implementation: getting started see the NICE guideline on melanoma.)Possible advantages of sentinel lymph node biopsy Possible disadvantages of sentinel lymph node biopsy   The operation helps to find out whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. It is better than ultrasound scans at finding very small cancers in the lymph nodes. The purpose of the operation is not to cure the cancer. There is no good evidence that people who have the operation live longer than people who do not have it. The operation can help predict what might happen in the future. For example, in people with a primary melanoma that is between 1 and 4 mm thick: around 1 out of 10 die within 10 years if the sentinel lymph node biopsy is negative around 3 out of 10 die within 10 years if the sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive. The result needs to be interpreted with caution. Of every 100 people who have a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, around 3 will subsequently develop a recurrence in the same group of lymph nodes. People who have had the operation may be able to take part in clinical trials of new treatments for melanoma. These trials often cannot accept people who haven t had this operation. A general anaesthetic is needed for the operation. The operation results in complications in between 4 and 10 out of every 100 people who have it.subhead:ImagingOffer CT staging to people with stage IIC melanoma who have not had sentinel lymph node biopsy and to people with stage III or suspected stage IV melanoma.Include the brain as part of imaging for people with suspected stage IV melanoma.Consider whole-body MRI for children and young people (from birth to 24 years) with stage III or suspected stage IV melanoma.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.6Sentinel lymph node biopsySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These areas may have been noticed during routine scanning. If they were noticed when looking for cancer that has spread from another part of the body, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want a CT (computed tomography) scan.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay.  The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.subhead: Depth of anaesthesia  monitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on depth of anaesthesia monitors \u2013 Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M. The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes.

The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.For further information, see what NICE says on preoperative tests.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance: cryotherapy for malignant endobronchial obstruction  photodynamic therapy for advanced bronchial carcinoma.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.8Curative treatment in people of borderline fitnessSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

All local follow-up policies should include reinforcing advice about self-examination, and health promotion for people with melanoma and their families, including sun awareness, avoiding vitamin D depletion, see sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels, and NICE s recommendations on stopping smoking in everyone.Continue to manage drug treatment for other conditions in line with the recommendations on drug treatment for other conditions after treatment for melanoma.subhead:Follow-up according to stageStage 0 melanomaDischarge people who have had stage 0 melanoma after completion of treatment and provide advice about self-examination and health promotion as described above.Stage IA melanomaFor people who have had stage IA melanoma, consider follow-up 2\u20134 times during the first year after completion of treatment and discharging them at the end of that year.Do not routinely offer screening investigations (including imaging and blood tests) as part of follow-up to people who have had stage IA melanoma.Stages IB\u2013IIB melanoma or stage IIC melanoma (fully staged using sentinel lymph node biopsy) For people who have had stages IB\u2013IIB melanoma or stage IIC melanoma with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, consider follow-up every 3 months for the first 3 years after completion of treatment, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and discharging them at the end of 5 years.

This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical.  Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms.

People with relapsed small-cell lung cancer currently receiving oral topotecan who do not meet the criteria specified above, or who are receiving intravenous topotecan should have the option to continue their treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop. NICE has written information for the public on topotecan.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
