Such research should be designed to generate robust evidence about the benefits of spinal cord stimulation (including pain relief, functional outcomes and quality of life) compared with standard care.Spinal cord stimulation should be provided only after an assessment by a multidisciplinary team experienced in chronic pain assessment and management of people with spinal cord stimulation devices, including experience in the provision of ongoing monitoring and support of the person assessed.When assessing the severity of pain and the trial of stimulation, the multidisciplinary team should be aware of the need to ensure equality of access to treatment with spinal cord stimulation. Tests to assess pain and response to spinal cord stimulation should take into account a person s disabilities (such as physical or sensory disabilities), or linguistic or other communication difficulties, and may need to be adapted.If different spinal cord stimulation systems are considered to be equally suitable for a person, the least costly should be used. Assessment of cost should take into account acquisition costs, the anticipated longevity of the system, the stimulation requirements of the person with chronic pain and the support package offered.People who are currently using spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain of ischaemic origin should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public on spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain of neuropathic or ischaemic origin.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance:  percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for refractory neuropathic pain deep brain stimulation for refractory chronic pain syndromes (excluding headache) stereotactic radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia using the gamma knife. subhead:Aptiva for painful diabetic neuropathyNICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on Aptiva for painful diabetic neuropathy.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
