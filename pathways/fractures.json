Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Please note that because of the reduction in prices for oral bisphosphonates over the last few years, the absolute risk level at which these drugs are cost-effective is now very low. The absolute risk level at which oral bisphosphonates are recommended as treatment options in this guidance are therefore not clinical intervention thresholds. In February 2018, NICE issued a clarification statement on implementation of this appraisal.Oral bisphosphonates (alendronic acid, ibandronic acid and risedronate sodium) are recommended as options for treating osteoporosis in adults only if: the person is eligible for risk assessment as defined in when to assess a person depending on age and sex and the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 1%.Intravenous bisphosphonates (ibandronic acid and zoledronic acid) are recommended as options for treating osteoporosis in adults only if: the person is eligible for risk assessment as defined in when to assess a person depending on age and sex and the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 10% or the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture is at least 1% and the person has difficulty taking oral bisphosphonates (alendronic acid, ibandronic acid or risedronate sodium) or these drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated.Estimate the 10-year probability of fragility fracture using the FRAX or QFracture risk tools, in line with recommendations on estimating absolute risk.The choice of treatment should be made on an individual basis after discussion between the responsible clinician and the patient, or their carers, about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments available. If several generic products are available, start treatment with the least expensive formulation, taking into account administration costs, the dose needed and the cost per dose.These recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with alendronic acid, ibandronic acid, risedronate sodium and zoledronic acid that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. Adults having treatment outside these recommendations may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.See why we made the recommendations on bisphosphonates.NICE has published information for the public explaining its guidance on bisphosphonates.subhead:Discuss stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 3 yearsTell a person who has been taking bisphosphonate for osteoporosis for at least 3 years that there is no consistent evidence of: further benefit from continuing bisphosphonate for another 3 years harms from stopping bisphosphonate after 3 years of treatment.Discuss stopping bisphosphonate after 3 years and include patient choice, fracture risk and life expectancy in the discussion.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Starting drug treatment3Adverse effects and adherence to treatment4Long-term follow-upSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This guidance relates only to treatments for the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis and have sustained a clinically apparent osteoporotic fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of \u20132.5 SD or below on DXA scanning. However, the diagnosis may be assumed in women aged 75 years or older if the responsible clinician considers a DXA scan to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible.This guidance assumes that women who receive treatment have an adequate calcium intake and are vitamin D replete. Unless clinicians are confident that women who receive treatment meet these criteria, calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation should be considered.This guidance does not cover the following: The use of raloxifene or teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in women with normal BMD or osteopenia (that is, women with a T-score between \u20131 and \u20132.5 SD below peak BMD). The use of these drugs for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in women who are on long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment.Raloxifene is recommended as an alternative treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women: who are unable to comply with the special instructions for the administration of alendronate and risedronate, or have a contraindication to or are intolerant of alendronate and either risedronate (as defined in intolerance below) and who also have a combination of T-score, age and number of independent clinical risk factors for fracture (see independent clinical risk factors below) as indicated in the following table.T-scores (SD) at (or below) which raloxifene is recommended when alendronate and risedronate cannot be takenNumber of independent clinical risk factors for fracture Age (years) 0 1 2 50\u201354 \u2014a -3.5 -3.5 55\u201359 -4.0 -3.5 -3.5 60\u201364 -4.0 -3.5 -3.5 65\u201369 -4.0 -3.5 -3.0 70\u201374 -3.0 -3.0 -2.5 75 or older -3.0 -2.5 -2.5 a Treatment with raloxifene is not recommended. If a woman aged 75 years or older who has one or more independent clinical risk factors for fracture or indicators of low BMD has not previously had her BMD measured, a DXA scan may not be required if the responsible clinician considers it to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible.For the purposes of this guidance, indicators of low BMD are low body mass index (defined as less than 22 kg/m2), medical conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn s disease, conditions that result in prolonged immobility, and untreated premature menopause. Rheumatoid arthritis is also a medical condition indicative of low BMD.Teriparatide is recommended as an alternative treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women: who are unable to take alendronate and risedronate, or have a contraindication to or are intolerant of alendronate and either risedronate or etidronate (as defined in intolerance below), or who have had an unsatisfactory response (as defined in unsatisfactory response below) to treatment with alendronate or risedronate and who are 65 years or older and have a T-score of \u20134.0 SD or below, or a T-score of \u20133.5 SD or below plus more than two fractures, or who are aged 55\u201364 years and have a T-score of  \u20134 SD or below plus more than two fractures.Independent clinical risk factorsFor the purposes of this guidance, independent clinical risk factors for fracture are parental history of hip fracture, alcohol intake of 4 or more units per day, and rheumatoid arthritis.IntoleranceFor the purposes of this guidance, intolerance of alendronate or risedronate is defined as persistent upper gastrointestinal disturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant discontinuation of treatment, and that occurs even though the instructions for administration have been followed correctly.Unsatisfactory responseFor the purposes of this guidance, an unsatisfactory response is defined as occurring when a woman has another fragility fracture despite adhering fully to treatment for 1 year and there is evidence of a decline in BMD below her pre-treatment baseline.Women currently receiving treatment Women who are currently receiving treatment with one of the drugs covered by this guidance, but for whom treatment would not have been recommended according to this guidance, should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.subhead:DenosumabThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on denosumab for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitorThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitor.The case for adopting the CardioQ-ODM in the NHS, when used as described below, is supported by the evidence. There is a reduction in post-operative complications, use of central venous catheters and in-hospital stay (with no increase in the rate of re-admission or repeat surgery) compared with conventional clinical assessment with or without invasive cardiovascular monitoring. The cost saving per patient, when the CardioQ-ODM is used instead of a central venous catheter in the peri-operative period, is about \u00a31,100 based on a 7.5-day hospital stay.The CardioQ-ODM should be considered for use in patients undergoing major or high-risk surgery or other surgical patients in whom a clinician would consider using invasive cardiovascular monitoring.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Image reportingSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This shows that the Ambu aScope2 is an acceptable alternative, where a multiple-use fibre optic endoscope is unavailable. There are also advantages during replacement of dislodged tracheostomy tubes in the intensive care setting. Making the Ambu aScope2 available for use across settings is likely to improve outcomes and patient safety.Adoption of the Ambu aScope2 is supported by cost modelling for a range of common clinical settings in which there is no multiple-use endoscope or where existing multiple-use endoscopes are not available. These settings are: isolated units, operating theatre units, and intensive care units, where the uses include the repositioning of displaced tracheostomy tubes. Although there were some uncertainties in the cost modelling, cost savings are likely in all settings modelled. The amount saved will depend on the number of intubations performed and on the number (if any) of existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes in use.The details of the cost modelling and estimated cost savings for each clinical setting are described in sections 5.16-5.20 of the guidance. As an example of the clinical area where savings could be greatest, using the Ambu aScope2 in the intensive care setting is estimated to be cost saving (\u00a33128 per year) when more than 700 intubations are conducted each year, when there are 2 or fewer existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes, and assuming that 5% of intubations are difficult.subhead:Translaryngeal tracheostomyNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on translaryngeal tracheostomy with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Airway managementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
