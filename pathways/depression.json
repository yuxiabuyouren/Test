Psychological and psychosocial interventions should be based on the relevant treatment manual(s), which should guide their structure and duration. Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of treatment monitor and evaluate treatment adherence and practitioner competence.Additional considerations for people with a chronic physical health problemIf a person s care is shared between primary and secondary care, there should be clear agreement between practitioners (especially the person s GP) on the responsibility for monitoring and treating that person. Share the treatment plan with the person and (if appropriate) with their family or carer.If a person s chronic physical health problem restricts their ability to engage with a psychosocial or psychological intervention for depression, discuss alternatives with the person, such as antidepressants or delivering the interventions by telephone if mobility or other difficulties prevent face-to-face contact.See what NICE says on multimorbidity.subhead:Treatment based on depression subtype and personal characteristics Do not routinely vary  treatment strategies by depression subtype (for example, atypical depression or seasonal depression) or personal characteristics (for example, sex or ethnicity).

In particular, healthcare professionals specialising in depression in children and young people should work with local CAMHS to enhance specialist knowledge and skills. This work should include providing training and help with guideline implementation. Detection and risk profiling \u2013 tier 1Healthcare professionals in primary care, schools and other relevant community settings should be trained in: detection of depressive symptoms and assessment of children/young people who may be at risk of depression. Training should include: the evaluation of recent and past psychosocial risk factors, such as: age gender family discord bullying physical, sexual or emotional abuse history of parental depression the natural history of single loss events the importance of multiple risk factors ethnic and cultural factors factors known to be associated with a high risk of depression and other health problems such as: homelessness refugee status living in institutional settings developing ethnically and culturally sensitive systems for detecting, assessing, supporting and referring children and young people who are either depressed or at significant risk of depression communications skills such as  active listening  and  conversational technique . In the provision of training by CAMHS professionals, give priority to the training of pastoral support staff in schools (particularly secondary schools), community paediatricians and GPs. Healthcare professionals in primary care should be familiar with screening for mood disorders. They should have regular access to specialist supervision and consultation. Recognition \u2013 tiers 2\u20134Tier 2\u20134 CAMHS professionals should be trained in improving accuracy in diagnosing depressive conditions. Interviewer-based instruments (such as K-SADS and CAPA) could be used but will require modification for regular use in busy routine CAMHS settings.Tier 3 CAMHS professionals who specialise in the treatment of depression should be trained in interviewer-based assessment instruments (such as K-SADS and CAPA) and have skills in nonverbal assessments of mood in younger children. Inpatient care \u2013 tier 4Tier 4 CAMHS professionals involved in assessing children/young people for possible inpatient admission should be specifically trained in: issues of consent and capacity use of current mental health legislation use of childcare lawsas they apply to this group of patients. Language and ethnic minorities \u2013 all tiersHealthcare professionals in primary, secondary and relevant community settings should be trained in cultural competence to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of depression in children and young people from black and minority ethnic groups. (Training should consider the impact of the patient s and healthcare professional s racial identity status on the patient s depression.) Healthcare professionals working with interpreters should be provided with joint training opportunities to ensure that both understand the specific requirements within a mental health setting. Stakeholders (involving patients and their families and carers, including members of black and minority ethnic groups) should be involved in development and evaluation of services.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Depression in children and young people1Confirming and recording a diagnosis5Monitoring progressSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If continuing treatment is necessary, make arrangements for a smooth transition to adult services and give information to the young person about the treatment and services they may need. The timing of transition may vary locally and individually but should usually be completed by the time the young person is 18 years. Variations should be agreed by both child and adult services.As part of the preparation for the transition to adult services, health and social care professionals should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the young person with autism. The assessment should make best use of existing documentation about personal, educational, occupational, social and communication functioning, and should include assessment of any coexisting conditions, especially depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD and global delay or intellectual disability in line with comprehensive assessment.For young people aged 16 or older whose needs are complex or severe, use the CPA in England, or care and treatment plans in Wales, as an aid to transfer between services. Involve the young person in the planning and, where appropriate, their parents or carers. Provide information about adult services to the young person, including their right to a social care assessment at age 18. During transition to adult services, consider a formal meeting involving health and social care and other relevant professionals from child and adult services.For more information, see NICE s recommendations on transition from children s to adults  services.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
