Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Such research should be designed to generate robust evidence about the benefits of spinal cord stimulation (including pain relief, functional outcomes and quality of life) compared with standard care.Spinal cord stimulation should be provided only after an assessment by a multidisciplinary team experienced in chronic pain assessment and management of people with spinal cord stimulation devices, including experience in the provision of ongoing monitoring and support of the person assessed.When assessing the severity of pain and the trial of stimulation, the multidisciplinary team should be aware of the need to ensure equality of access to treatment with spinal cord stimulation. Tests to assess pain and response to spinal cord stimulation should take into account a person s disabilities (such as physical or sensory disabilities), or linguistic or other communication difficulties, and may need to be adapted.If different spinal cord stimulation systems are considered to be equally suitable for a person, the least costly should be used. Assessment of cost should take into account acquisition costs, the anticipated longevity of the system, the stimulation requirements of the person with chronic pain and the support package offered.People who are currently using spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain of ischaemic origin should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain of neuropathic or ischaemic origin.subhead:Interventional procedures guidanceNICE has published guidance on the following with standard or normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit: minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery for chronic sacroiliac pain percutaneous coblation of the intervertebral disc for low back pain and sciatica  non-rigid stabilisation techniques for the treatment of low back pain interspinous distraction procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudication  percutaneous intradiscal laser ablation in the lumbar spine.NICE has published guidance on the following with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research: percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain percutaneous electrothermal treatment of the intervertebral disc annulus for low back pain and sciatica insertion of an annular disc implant at lumbar discectomy peripheral nerve-field stimulation for chronic low back pain  automated percutaneous mechanical lumbar discectomy.NICE has published guidance that  epiduroscopic lumbar discectomy through the sacral hiatus for sciatica should only be used in the context of research.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This shows that the Ambu aScope2 is an acceptable alternative, where a multiple-use fibre optic endoscope is unavailable. There are also advantages during replacement of dislodged tracheostomy tubes in the intensive care setting. Making the Ambu aScope2 available for use across settings is likely to improve outcomes and patient safety.Adoption of the Ambu aScope2 is supported by cost modelling for a range of common clinical settings in which there is no multiple-use endoscope or where existing multiple-use endoscopes are not available. These settings are: isolated units, operating theatre units, and intensive care units, where the uses include the repositioning of displaced tracheostomy tubes. Although there were some uncertainties in the cost modelling, cost savings are likely in all settings modelled. The amount saved will depend on the number of intubations performed and on the number (if any) of existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes in use.The details of the cost modelling and estimated cost savings for each clinical setting are described in sections 5.16-5.20 of the guidance. As an example of the clinical area where savings could be greatest, using the Ambu aScope2 in the intensive care setting is estimated to be cost saving (\u00a33128 per year) when more than 700 intubations are conducted each year, when there are 2 or fewer existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes, and assuming that 5% of intubations are difficult.subhead:Translaryngeal tracheostomyNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on translaryngeal tracheostomy with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Airway managementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Consider immediate CT for young people and adults with suspected chest trauma without severe respiratory compromise who are responding to resuscitation or whose haemodynamic status is normal. subhead:Thopaz+ for managing chest drainsThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on Thopaz+ portable digital system for managing chest drains.The case for adopting Thopaz+ for managing chest drains is supported by the evidence. Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Image reportingSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
