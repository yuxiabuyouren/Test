GreenLight XPS is at least as effective in these patients as TURP, but can more often be done as a day-case procedure, following appropriate service redesign. There is currently insufficient high-quality, comparative evidence to support the routine adoption of GreenLight XPS in high-risk patients, that is those who:have an increased risk of bleeding orhave prostates larger than 100 ml orhave urinary retention. NICE recommends that specialists collaborate in collecting and publishing data on the comparative effectiveness of GreenLight XPS for high-risk patients to supplement the currently limited published evidence. Cost modelling indicates that in non-high-risk patients, cost savings with GreenLight XPS compared with TURP are determined by the proportion of procedures done as day cases. Assuming a day-case procedure rate of 36%, and that the GreenLight XPS console is provided at no cost to the hospital (based on a contracted commitment to fibre usage), the estimated cost saving is \u00a360 per patient. NICE s resource impact report estimates that the annual cost saving for the NHS in England is around \u00a32.3 million. In a plausible scenario of 70% of treatments being done as day cases, the cost saving may be up to \u00a33.2 million. NICE recommends that hospitals adopting GreenLight XPS plan for service redesign to ensure that day-case treatment can be delivered appropriately. UroLift for treating lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasiaThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on UroLift for treating lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.The clinical case for adopting the UroLift system for treating lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia is supported by the evidence. The UroLift system relieves lower urinary tract symptoms while avoiding the risk to sexual function associated with transurethral resection of the prostate and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. Using the system reduces the length of a person s stay in hospital. It can also be used in a day-surgery unit.The UroLift system should be considered as an alternative to current surgical procedures for use in a day-case setting in men with lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia who are aged 50 years and older and who have a prostate of less than 100 ml without an obstructing middle lobe.The primary cost drivers in the model were the cost of each implant and the number of implants used per treatment (the modelling assumed 4). Compared with monopolar and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (done as an inpatient procedure, which is most common), using the UroLift system in a day-surgery unit results in cost savings of around \u00a3286 and \u00a3159 per patient. There was uncertainty over the procedure duration in the model, but this made little difference to the cost case. TURis system for transurethral resection of the prostateThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the TURis system for transurethral resection of the prostate.The case for adopting the TURis system for resection of the prostate is supported by the evidence. Using bipolar diathermy with TURis instead of a monopolar system avoids the risk of transurethral resection syndrome and reduces the need for blood transfusion. It may also reduce the length of hospital stay and hospital readmissions.Using the TURis system instead of monopolar TURP results in an estimated saving of \u00a371 per patient for hospitals that already use an Olympus monopolar system and an estimated additional cost of \u00a320 per patient for other hospitals. However, there is some evidence of a reduction in readmissions with the TURis system compared with monopolar TURP. If this evidence is included, using the TURis system results in an estimated saving of \u00a3375 per patient for hospitals that already use an Olympus monopolar system and an estimated saving of \u00a3285 per patient for other hospitals.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit: sacral nerve stimulation for idiopathic chronic non-obstructive urinary retention insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants to treat lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia holmium laser prostatectomy  transurethral electrovaporisation of the prostate.NICE has published guidance on laparoscopic prostatectomy for benign prostatic obstruction with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.NICE has published guidance that prostate artery embolisation for benign prostatic hyperplasia should only be used in the context of research.subhead:StentsNICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on Memokath-028, 044 and 045 stents for urethral obstruction.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.8Surgery for voiding symptomsSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
