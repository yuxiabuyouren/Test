Consider psychological treatment at these times. Be familiar with local and national guidelines on confidentiality and the rights of the child, parental consent and responsibilities, child protection issues, the Mental Health Act (2007) and the Children Act (1989). subhead:Providing informationProvide relevant, age-appropriate written information to people with ADHD and their families and carers about diagnosis, assessment, support, self-help, psychological treatment, drug treatment and possible side effects. Give adults with ADHD written information about local and national support groups and voluntary organisations. NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on ADHD. subhead:Carer supportAsk families or carers about the impact of ADHD on themselves and other family members and discuss their concerns.Offer families or carers an assessment of their personal, social and mental health needs.Encourage participation in support and self-help groups if appropriate.Advise about positive parent\u2013 and carer\u2013child contact, clear and appropriate rules about behaviour and structuring the child or young person s day.Explain that parent-training/education programmes aim to optimise parenting skills to meet the above-average parenting needs of children and young people with ADHD and do not necessarily imply bad parenting.

If it does, arrange for transition to adult services (usually by age 18), giving details of the anticipated treatment and services required. Consider a formal meeting involving CAMHS and/or paediatrics and adult psychiatric services. Give the young person information about adult services and involve them, and when appropriate their parent or carer, in the planning. Use the care programme approach for young people aged 16 years and older. After transition, carry out an assessment of personal, educational, occupational and social functioning, and coexisting conditions, especially drug misuse, personality disorders, emotional problems and learning difficulties.
