If a person with CFS/ME undertakes an exclusion diet or dietary manipulation, seek advice from a dietitian because of the risk of malnutrition.

Acknowledge the reality and impact of the condition and the symptoms. Provide information about the range of interventions and management strategies as detailed in this pathway (such as the benefits, risks and likely side effects). Provide information on the possible causes, nature and course of CFS/ME. Provide information on returning to work or education. Take account of the person s age (particularly for children younger than 12 years), the severity of their CFS/ME, their preferences and experiences, and the outcome of previous treatment(s). Offer information about local and national self-help groups and support groups for people with CFS/ME and their carers (see also the NHS Expert Patients Programme or Education Programme for Patients Wales). When providing care for children and young people, follow best practice as described in the national service frameworks for children for England or for Wales. Be aware that \u2013 like all people receiving care in the NHS \u2013 people with CFS/ME have the right to refuse or withdraw from any component of their care plan without this affecting other aspects of their care, or future choices about care. Recognise that the person with CFS/ME is in charge of the aims and goals of the overall management plan. The pace of progression throughout the course of any intervention should be mutually agreed. Provide diagnostic and therapeutic options to people with CFS/ME in ways that are suitable for the individual person. This may include providing domiciliary services (including specialist assessment) or using methods such as telephone or email. subhead:Support and information To facilitate effective management of the condition, aim to establish a supportive and collaborative relationship with the person with CFS/ME and their carers. Engagement with the family is particularly important for children and young people, and for people with severe CFS/ME. A named healthcare professional should be responsible for coordinating care for each person with CFS/ME. Provide accurate information to people at all stages of CFS/ME, starting from when a diagnosis is first being considered. This should be tailored to the person s circumstances, including the stage and duration of the condition, symptoms experienced and relevant personal and social factors. Provide  information in a variety of formats if appropriate (printed copy, electronic and audio), which people with CFS/ME and their carers can refer to at home and in the clinical setting. NICE has written information for the public explaining the guidance on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. subhead:Provision of care Healthcare professionals responsible for caring for people with CFS/ME should have appropriate skills and expertise in the condition. Offer every person diagnosed with CFS/ME: information about the illness (see support and information) acceptance and understanding assistance negotiating the healthcare, benefits and social care systems assistance with occupational activities including work and education if appropriate (see education and employment in this pathway). Develop an individualised management plan with the person with CFS/ME, and their carers if appropriate. Review and document changes to the plan at each contact. Include: relevant symptoms and history  plans for care and treatment, including managing setbacks/relapses (see plan for and manage setbacks and relapses in this pathway) information and support needs any education, training or employment support needs  details of the healthcare professionals involved in care and their contact details. NICE has produced a pathway on transition from children s to adults  services.subhead:People with severe CFS/MEManagement of severe CFS/ME is difficult and complex and healthcare professionals should recognise that specialist expertise is needed when planning and providing care for people with severe CFS/ME. Diagnosis, investigations, management and follow-up care for people with severe CFS/ME should be supervised or supported by a specialist in CFS/ME. People with severe CFS/ME may need to use community services at times. These services may include nursing, occupational therapy, dietetics, respite care, psychology and physiotherapy (see the  National service framework for long-term conditions ). The input of different professionals should be coordinated by a named professional. Offer people with severe CFS/ME a summary record of every consultation because of their cognitive difficulties. Most people with CFS/ME will not need hospital admission. However, there may be circumstances when a planned admission should be considered. The decision to admit should be made with the person with CFS/ME and their family, and be based on an informed consideration of the benefits and disadvantages. For example, a planned admission may be useful if assessment of a management plan and investigations would require frequent visits to the hospital.For information on prolonged bed rest for people with severe CFS/ME, see sleep, rest and relaxation in this pathway.

Base graded exercise therapy on the person s current level of activities (such as physical activity, daily routines, sleep patterns and frequency of setbacks/relapses) and emotional factors, vocational or educational factors and individual goals (details of these may be obtained from an activity diary). The programme should also include sleep and relaxation strategies (see sleep, rest and relaxation in this pathway). When planning graded exercise therapy: Undertake an activity analysis to ensure that the person with CFS/ME is not in a  boom and bust  cycle before they increase the time spent in exercise. Discuss with the person the ultimate goals that are important and relevant to them. This might be, for example, a twice-daily short walk to the shops, a return to a previous active hobby such as cycling or gardening, or, for people with severe CFS/ME, sitting up in bed to eat a meal. Recognise that it can take weeks, months or even years to achieve goals, and ensure that this is taken into account in the therapy structure (for example, by setting short- and medium-term goals). Explain symptoms and the benefits of exercise in a physiological context. When starting graded exercise therapy:  Assess the person s current daily activities to determine their baseline.  Agree with them a level of additional low-intensity exercise that is sustainable, independent of daily fluctuations in symptoms, and does not lead to  boom and bust  cycles. This may be sitting up in bed or brushing hair, for example, for people with severe CFS/ME, or gentle stretches or a slow walk.  Encourage them to undertake this exercise for at least 5 days out of 7, or build up to this level if and when possible. Advise them that this level of exercise may mildly increase symptoms for a few days (for example, a mild to moderate increase in stiffness and fatigue), explain why this may occur and discuss strategies to mitigate it. Offer information on the management of setbacks/relapses (see plan for and manage setbacks and relapses in this pathway). subhead:Progressing with graded exercise therapy When the low-intensity exercise can be sustained for 5 days out of 7 (usually accompanied by a reduction in perceived exertion), review and increase the duration, if appropriate, by up to 20%. For example, a 5-minute walk becomes 6 minutes, or a person with severe CFS/ME sits up in bed for a longer period, or walks to another room more often. The aim is to reach 30 minutes of low-intensity exercise. When the duration of low-intensity exercise has reached 30 minutes, increase the intensity of the exercise gradually up to an aerobic heart rate zone, as assessed individually.. A rate of 50\u201370% maximum heart rate is recommended. Measure exercise intensity using a heart rate monitor, so that the person knows they are within their target heart rate zone. If agreed  graded exercise therapy goals are met, increase exercise duration and intensity further if appropriate, if other daily activities can also be sustained, and in agreement with the person with CFS/ME. subhead:Maintaining exerciseAfter completing a graded exercise therapy programme, continue working together to develop and build on strategies to maintain exercise. Provide support, if needed, to enable the person to reinforce the learning and lifestyle changes made and continue graded exercise therapy beyond discharge.

Therefore, address the ability of a person with CFS/ME to continue in education or work early and review regularly. Proactively advise about fitness for work and education, and recommend flexible adjustments or adaptations to work or studies to help people with CFS/ME to return to them when they are ready and fit enough. This may include, with the informed consent of the person with CFS/ME, liaising with employers, education providers and support services, such as:  occupational health services disability services through Jobcentre Plus  schools, home education services and local education authorities disability advisers in universities and colleges. For people with CFS/ME who are able to continue in or return to education or employment, ensure, with the person s informed consent, that employers, occupational health or education institutions have information on the condition and the agreed management plan. subhead:EducationFollow the guidance from the Department for Children, Schools and Families on education for children and young people with medical needs, or equivalent statutory guidance. Work closely with social care and education services to ensure a common understanding of the goals of the person with CFS/ME. The use of a flexible approach should be discussed, including home tuition and use of equipment that allows a gradual reintegration into education. Time in education should not be used as a sole marker of progress of CFS/ME, and education should not be the only activity a person undertakes. There should be a balance between time spent attending school or college and doing homework, and time spent on home and social activities. subhead:EmploymentIf possible, and with the informed consent of the person with CFS/ME, discuss employment issues with occupational health professionals, who will communicate with the person s manager or human resources representative. If there is no access to occupational health services, the responsible clinician should liaise with the employer directly.

Do not offer the following strategies to people with CFS/ME:  Advice to undertake unsupervised, or unstructured, vigorous exercise (such as simply  go to the gym  or  exercise more ) because this may worsen symptoms. Specialist management programmes (see specialist CFS/ME care in this pathway) delivered by practitioners with no experience in the condition. Although there is considerable support from patients (particularly people with severe CFS/ME) for the following strategies, be aware that there is no controlled trial evidence of benefit:  Encouraging maintenance of activity levels at substantially less than full capacity to reserve energy for the body to heal itself (sometimes known as the envelope theory).  Encouraging complete rest (cognitive, physical and emotional) during a setback/relapse.

Develop a plan for managing setbacks/relapses, so that skills, strategies, resources and support are readily available and accessible when needed. This plan may be shared with the person s carers, if they agree. subhead:During a setback/relapseSetbacks/relapses may be triggered by factors such as unexpected/unplanned activities, poor sleep, infection or stress. In discussion with the person with CFS/ME, try to identify the cause(s) of a setback/relapse, but recognise that this may not always be possible. Review the management plan when managing a setback/relapse. Discuss and agree an appropriate course of action with the person with CFS/ME, taking into account: the person s experience possible causes of the setback/relapse, if known the nature of the symptoms the severity and duration of the setback/relapse the current management plan. When managing setbacks, put strategies in place that: Include relaxation and breathing techniques. Maintain activity and exercise levels if possible, by alternating activities with breaks and pacing activities, as appropriate. Involve talking to families and carers, if appropriate. Recognise distressing thoughts about setbacks/relapses such as  this means I ll never get better , but encourage optimism. Involve reconsidering and revising the levels and types of symptom control. In some setbacks/relapses, it may be necessary to reduce, or even stop some activities and increase the frequency and/or duration of rest periods to stabilise symptoms and re-establish a baseline activity level. This should be discussed and agreed with the person with CFS/ME. Advise people with CFS/ME to minimise daytime sleep periods. However, recognise that this is not always possible, depending on the severity of a person s symptoms and the setback. subhead:After a setback/relapseAfter a setback/relapse, review the person s activity levels to re-establish a baseline and review the management plan. Encourage a gradual return, when possible, to previous exercise and functional routines. Increase activity gradually. Advise: Slowly decreasing the frequency and duration of rest periods. Continuing the use of relaxation techniques, even when the person with CFS/ME is beginning to feel better. After a setback, review the experience to determine, if possible, whether triggers can be managed in the future, and put strategies in place to do this.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
