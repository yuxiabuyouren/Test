Hip X-rayOffer a hip X-ray to assess for hip displacement:  if there are clinical concerns about possible hip displacement at 24 months in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Consider repeating the hip X-ray annually in children or young people who are at GMFCS level III, IV or V. Consider repeating the hip X-ray after 6 months in children and young people where the initial hip migration is greater than 30%, and then consider repeating the hip X-ray every 6 months after this if the hip migration is increasing by more than 10 percentage points per year.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The network of care should provide access to a team of healthcare professionals experienced in the care of children and young people with spasticity. The network team should provide local expertise in paediatrics, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Access to other expertise, including orthotics, orthopaedic surgery and/or neurosurgery and paediatric neurology, may be provided locally or regionally. If a child or young person receives treatment for spasticity from healthcare professionals outside the network team, this should be planned and undertaken in discussion with the network team to ensure integrated care and effective subsequent management. The network of care should have a pathway for monitoring children and young people at increased risk of hip displacement.
