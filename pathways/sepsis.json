acute hospital setting).Ensure GPs and ambulance services have mechanisms in place to give antibiotics for people with high risk criteria in pre-hospital settings in location where transfer time is more than 1 hour.For patients in hospital who have suspected infections, take microbiological samples before prescribing an antimicrobial and review the prescription when the results are available. For people with suspected sepsis take blood cultures before antibiotics are given. If meningococcal disease is specifically suspected (fever and purpuric rash) give appropriate doses of parenteral benzyl penicillin in community settings and intravenous ceftriaxone in hospital settings. For all people with suspected sepsis where the source of infection is clear use existing local antimicrobial guidance.For people aged up to 17 years (except neonates) with suspected community acquired sepsis of any cause give ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once a day with a maximum dose of 4g daily at any age. For people aged up to 17 years with suspected sepsis who are already in hospital, or who are known to have previously been infected with or colonised with ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria, consult local guidelines for choice of antibiotic.For children younger than 3 months, give an additional antibiotic active against listeria (for example, ampicillin or amoxicillin). Treat neonates presenting in hospital in their first 72 hours with suspected sepsis with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.

If 40 weeks corrected gestational age or below or receiving an intravenous calcium infusion use cefotaxime 50 mg/kg every 6 to 12 hours, depending on the age of the neonate.Follow NICE s recommendations on antimicrobial stewardship when prescribing and using antibiotics to treat people with suspected or confirmed sepsis.Diagnostic testingThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on procalcitonin testing for diagnosing and monitoring sepsis.The procalcitonin tests (ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay, BRAHMS PCT Sensitive Kryptor assay, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT assay and VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay) show promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption in the NHS. Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend.

Take into account pre-existing conditions (for example, cardiac disease or kidney disease), because smaller fluid volumes may be needed.Use a pump, or syringe if no pump is available, to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to children under 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form.If neonates need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids (normal saline) that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 10\u201320 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes.subhead:OxygenOxygen should be given to children with suspected sepsis who have signs of shock or oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 92% when breathing air.

Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend. Do not use starch-based solutions or hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation for people with sepsis.Consider human albumin solution 4\u20135% for fluid resuscitation only in patients with sepsis and shock.If children and young people up to 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes. Take into account pre-existing conditions (for example, cardiac disease or kidney disease), because smaller fluid volumes may be needed.Use a pump, or syringe if no pump is available, to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to children under 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form.subhead:OxygenOxygen should be given to children with suspected sepsis who have signs of shock or oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 92% when breathing air. Treatment with oxygen should also be considered for children with an SpO2 of greater than 92%, as clinically indicated.See what NICE says on bacterial meningitis and meningococcal septicaemia and intravenous fluid therapy in hospital.SourcesNG51NG29DG18", "drug": {"ceftriaxone": "DB01212"}}}, {"category": "treatment", "id": "t6136", "name": "antimicrobial stewardship, medicines optimisation and patient experience", "draggable": "true", "value": {"name": "antimicrobial stewardship, medicines optimisation and patient experience", "type": "treatment related", "time": "", "intention": "", "description": "title:antimicrobial stewardship, medicines optimisation and patient experiencehead:Antimicrobial stewardship, medicines optimisation and patient experience in NHS servicesSee what NICE says on: antimicrobial stewardship  medicines optimisation patient experience.", "drug": {}}}, {"category": "treatment", "id": "t6124", "name": "training for healthcare professionals", "draggable": "true", "value": {"name": "training for healthcare professionals", "type": "treatment related", "time": "", "intention": "", "description": "title:training for healthcare professionalshead:Training for healthcare professionalsHealthcare professionals and staff who come into contact with patients having anticancer treatment should be provided with training on neutropenic sepsis.
