Reassure people in the safety netting group (see referral and safety netting) who are concerned that they may have cancer that with their current symptoms their risk of having cancer is low.  Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see referral and safety netting) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist.
