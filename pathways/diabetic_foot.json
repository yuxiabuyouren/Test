Examples of limb-threatening and life-threatening diabetic foot problems include the following: Ulceration with fever or any signs of sepsis (see what NICE says on sepsis). Ulceration with limb ischaemia (see what NICE says on lower limb peripheral arterial disease). Clinical concern that there is a deep-seated soft tissue or bone infection (with or without ulceration). Gangrene (with or without ulceration).For all other active diabetic foot problems, refer the person within 1 working day to the multidisciplinary foot care service or foot protection service (according to local protocols and pathways; also see principles of care) for triage within 1 further working day. Be aware that if a person with diabetes fractures their foot or ankle, it may progress to Charcot arthropathy.Suspect acute Charcot arthropathy if there is redness, warmth, swelling or deformity (in particular, when the skin is intact), especially in the presence of peripheral neuropathy or renal failure. Think about acute Charcot arthropathy even when deformity is not present or pain is not reported. To confirm the diagnosis of acute Charcot arthropathy, refer the person within 1 working day to the multidisciplinary foot care service for triage within 1 further working day.

Assess the vascular status of the lower limbs. Liaise with other healthcare professionals, for example, the person s GP, about the person s diabetes management and risk of cardiovascular disease. Depending on the person s risk of developing a diabetic foot problem, carry out reassessments at the following intervals: Annually for people who are at low risk. Frequently (for example, every 3\u20136 months) for people who are at moderate risk.  More frequently (for example, every 1\u20132 months) for people who are at high risk, if there is no immediate concern.

Control of foot infection. Control of ischaemia.  Wound debridement.  Wound dressings. Offer non-removable casting to offload plantar neuropathic, non-ischaemic, uninfected forefoot and midfoot diabetic ulcers. Offer an alternative offloading device until casting can be provided. In line with NICE s recommendations on pressure ulcers, use pressure-redistributing devices and strategies to minimise the risk of pressure ulcers developing. When treating diabetic foot ulcers, debridement in hospital should only be done by healthcare professionals from the multidisciplinary foot care service, using the technique that best matches their specialist expertise and clinical experience, the site of the diabetic foot ulcer and the person s preference. When treating diabetic foot ulcers, debridement in the community should only be done by healthcare professionals with the relevant training and skills, continuing the care described in the person s treatment plan. Consider negative pressure wound therapy after surgical debridement for diabetic foot ulcers, on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service. When deciding about wound dressings and offloading when treating diabetic foot ulcers, take into account the clinical assessment of the wound and the person s preference, and use devices and dressings with the lowest acquisition cost appropriate to the clinical circumstances. Consider dermal or skin substitutes as an adjunct to standard care when treating diabetic foot ulcers, only when healing has not progressed and on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service. Do not offer the following to treat diabetic foot ulcers, unless as part of a clinical trial: Electrical stimulation therapy, autologous platelet-rich plasma gel, regenerative wound matrices and dalteparin. Growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], epidermal growth factor [EGF] and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-\u03b2]). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. When deciding the frequency of follow-up as part of the treatment plan, take into account the overall health of the person with diabetes, how healing has progressed, and any deterioration. Ensure that the frequency of monitoring set out in the person s individualised treatment plan is maintained whether the person with diabetes is being treated in hospital or in the community. subhead:The Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad for use in acute or chronic wounds The following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad for use in acute or chronic wounds.The case for adopting the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad as part of the management of acute or chronic wounds in the community is supported by the evidence. The available evidence is limited, but the likely benefits of using the Debrisoft pad on appropriate wounds are that they will be fully debrided more quickly, with fewer nurse visits needed, compared with other debridement methods. In addition, the Debrisoft pad is convenient and easy to use, and is well tolerated by patients. Debridement is an important component of standard woundcare management as also described in NICE s recommendations on pressure ulcers.The Debrisoft pad is indicated for adults and children with acute or chronic wounds. The available evidence is mainly in adults with chronic wounds needing debridement in the community. The data show that the device is particularly effective for chronic sloughy wounds and hyperkeratotic skin around acute or chronic wounds. The Debrisoft pad is estimated to be cost saving for complete debridement compared with other debridement methods. When compared with hydrogel, gauze and bagged larvae, cost savings per patient (per complete debridement) are estimated to be \u00a399, \u00a3152 and \u00a3484 respectively in a community clinic and \u00a3222, \u00a3347 and \u00a3469 respectively in the home.
