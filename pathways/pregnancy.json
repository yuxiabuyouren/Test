High levels of salt in processed food have a major impact on the total amount consumed by the population. Over recent years the food industry, working with the Food Standards Agency, has made considerable progress in reducing salt in everyday foods. As a result, products with no added salt are now increasingly available. However, it is taking too long to reduce average salt intake among the population. Furthermore, average intake among children is above the recommended level \u2013 and some children consume as much salt as adults. Progress towards a low-salt diet needs to be accelerated as a matter of urgency.Policy goalReduce population-level consumption of salt. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAccelerate the reduction in salt intake among the population. Aim for a maximum intake of 6 g per day per adult by 2015 and 3 g by 2025.Ensure children s salt intake does not exceed age-appropriate guidelines (these guidelines should be based on up-to-date assessments of the available scientific evidence). Promote the benefits of a reduction in the population s salt intake to the European Union (EU). Introduce national legislation if necessary.Ensure national policy on salt in England is not weakened by less effective action in other parts of the EU.Ensure food producers and caterers continue to reduce the salt content of commonly consumed foods (including bread, meat products, cheese, soups and breakfast cereals). This can be achieved by progressively changing recipes, products and manufacturing and production methods.Establish the principle that children under 11 should consume substantially less salt than adults. (This is based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.)Support the Department of Health so that it can continue to promote \u2013 and take the lead on \u2013 the development of EU-wide salt targets for processed foods. Establish an independent system for monitoring national salt levels in commonly consumed foods.Ensure low-salt products are sold more cheaply than their higher salt equivalents. Clearly label products which are naturally high in salt and cannot meaningfully be reformulated. Use the traffic light system developed by the Food Standards Agency. The labels should also state that these products should only be consumed occasionally. Discourage the use of potassium and other substitutes to replace salt. The aim of avoiding potassium substitution is twofold: to help consumers  readjust their perception of  saltiness  and to avoid additives which may have other effects on health.Promote best practice in relation to the reduction of salt consumption, as exemplified in these recommendations, to the wider EU.subhead:Saturated fatsContextReducing general consumption of saturated fat is crucial to preventing CVD. Over recent years, much has been done (by the Food Standards Agency, consumers and industry) to reduce the population s intake. Consumption levels are gradually moving towards the goal set by the Food Standards Agency: to reduce population intake of saturated fat from 13.3% to below 11% of food energy. However, a further substantial reduction would greatly reduce CVD and deaths from CVD. Taking the example of Japan (where consumption of saturated fat is much lower than in the UK), halving the average intake (from 14% to 6\u20137% of total energy) might prevent approximately 30,000 CVD deaths annually. It would also prevent a corresponding number of new cases of CVD annually. (Note that low-fat products are not recommended for children under 2 years, but are fine thereafter.)Policy goal Reduce population-level consumption of saturated fat. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage manufacturers, caterers and producers to reduce substantially the amount of saturated fat in all food products. If necessary, consider supportive legislation. Ensure no manufacturer, caterer or producer is at an unfair advantage as a result.Create the conditions whereby products containing lower levels of saturated fat are sold more cheaply than high saturated fat products. Consider legislation and fiscal levers if necessary.Create favourable conditions for industry and agriculture to produce dairy products for human consumption that are low in saturated fat.Continue to promote semi-skimmed milk for children aged over 2 years. This is in line with the American Heart Association s pediatric dietary strategyAmerican Heart Association (2005) Dietary recommendations for children and adolescents. A guide for practitioners: consensus statement from the American Heart Association. Circulation 112: 2061\u201375. Available at http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/13/2061.subhead:Trans fatsContextIPTFAs constitute a significant health hazard. In recent years many manufacturers and caterers, with the encouragement of the Food Standards Agency and other organisations, have considerably reduced the amount of IPTFAs in their products. However, certain sections of the population may be consuming a substantially higher amount of IPTFAs than average (for instance, those who regularly eat fried fast-food). It is important to protect all social groups from the adverse effects of IPTFAs. In some countries and regions (for instance, Denmark, Austria and New York), IPTFAs have been successfully banned. A study for the European Parliament recently recommended that it, too, should consider an EU-wide ban. In the meantime, some large UK caterers, retailers and producers have removed IPTFAs from their products.Policy goalEnsure all groups in the population are protected from the harmful effects of IPTFAs. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEliminate the use of IPTFAs for human consumption.In line with other EU countries (specifically, Denmark and Austria), introduce legislation to ensure that IPTFA levels do not exceed 2% in the fats and oils used in food manufacturing and cooking.Direct the bodies responsible for national surveys to measure and report on consumption of IPTFAs by different population subgroups \u2013 rather than only by mean consumption across the population as a whole.Establish guidelines for local authorities to monitor independently IPTFA levels in the restaurant, fast-food and home food trades using existing statutory powers (in relation to trading standards or environmental health).Create and sustain local and national conditions which support a reduction in the amount of IPTFAs in foods, while ensuring levels of saturated fat are not increased. Encourage the use of vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to replace oils containing IPTFAs. Saturated fats should not be used as an IPTFA substitute.Develop UK-validated guidelines and information for the food service sector and local government on removing IPTFAs from the food preparation process. This will support UK-wide implementation of any legislation produced on IPTFAs. SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Current advertising restrictions have reduced the number of advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar during television programmes made for children and young people. However, advertisements, promotions, product placements and sponsorship shown between programmes for older audiences also have a powerful influence on children and young people. Marketing bans have been successfully introduced in several other countries; evidence shows that a 9pm watershed for such TV advertisements would reduce children and young people s exposure to this type of advertising by 82%Office of Communications (2006) Annex 7 \u2013 impact assessment. Annex to consultation on television advertising of food and drink to children. .Policy goalEnsure children and young people under 16 are protected from all forms of marketing, advertising and promotions (including product placements) which encourage an unhealthy diet. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsDevelop a comprehensive, agreed set of principles for food and beverage marketing aimed at children and young people. This could be similar to the  Sydney principles Swinburn B, Sacks G, Lobstein T et al. (2007) The  Sydney principles  for reducing the commercial promotion of foods and beverages to children. Public Health Nutrition 11 (9): 881\u20136.. They should be based on a child s right to a healthy diet.Extend TV advertising scheduling restrictions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar (as determined by the nutrient profile developed by the Food Standards Agency) up to 9pm.Develop equivalent standards, supported by legislation, to restrict the marketing, advertising and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar via all non-broadcast media. This includes manufacturers  websites, use of the Internet generally, mobile phones and other new technologies.Ensure restrictions for non-broadcast media on advertising, marketing and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar are underpinned by the nutrient profiling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.subhead:Commercial interests ContextIf deaths and illnesses associated with cardiovascular disease are to be reduced, it is important that food and drink manufacturers, retailers, caterers, producers and growers, along with associated organisations, deliver goods that underpin this goal. Many commercial organisations are already taking positive action.Policy goalEnsure dealings between government, government agencies and the commercial sector are conducted in a transparent manner that supports public health objectives and is in line with best practice. (This includes full disclosure of interests.) To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage best practice for all meetings, including lobbying, between the food and drink industry and government (and government agencies). This includes full disclosure of interests by all parties. It also involves a requirement that information provided by the food and drink, catering and agriculture industries is available for the general public and is auditable.

Use information from sources such as the joint strategic needs assessment and local cycling and walking implementation plans. Follow established best practice to ensure everyone s needs are identified and addressed, including those of people with limited mobility. Use community engagement approaches to develop and review these local strategies, policies and plans:  Take account of the views and needs of people who walk, cycle, drive or use public transport in the local area, particularly in relation to shared or contested space. (For example, space shared by pedestrians and cyclists, or cyclists and motorists.)  Take account of the views and needs of people with limited mobility who may be adversely affected by the design and maintenance of streets, footways and footpaths and urban and rural public open spaces. Take account of the views of voluntary and community sector organisations. Assess whether initiatives successfully adopted elsewhere are appropriate locally and, if they are, how they can be adapted to local needs.See why we made the recommendations on encouraging and enabling increased physical activity.For more information see NICE s recommendations on community engagement.subhead:People with limited mobilityDevelop and put policies into place to ensure people with limited mobility can safely move along and across streets and in public open spaces:  Adopt a consistent approach to permanent or temporary obstructions. This may include vegetation, vending boards, bins, parked cars, scaffolding and street furniture.  Ensure that there are enough pedestrian-controlled crossings, and that they all incorporate accessibility features. Also ensure that signal-controlled crossings give enough time to cross the road safely. Provide accessible temporary crossings during street and road works (see the Department for Transport s Safety at street works and road works). Use and maintain tactile paving and dropped kerbs correctly (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces).  Provide step-free access or, where this is not possible, clearly signposted accessible alternatives. See why we made the recommendations on policies for people with limited mobility.subhead:Prioritise physical activity in daily lifeEnsure planning permissions always prioritise the need for people (including people with limited mobility) to be physically active as a routine part of their daily life, for example ensuring access on foot to local services such as shops and public transport stops.For more information see Public Health England s Spatial planning for health report. Ensure children, young people and their families and carers can be physically active, for example when playing and when travelling to school, college and early years settings.Use existing health impact assessment tools to assess in advance what impact (both intended and unintended) any proposed changes are likely to have on physical activity levels. For example, will local services be accessible on foot, by bike, and by people with limited mobility?

As part of their continuing professional development, train health professionals, including doctors, dietitians and pharmacists, to promote and support breastfeeding, using UNICEF s Baby Friendly Initiative training as a minimum standard. Ensure health professionals who provide information and advice to breastfeeding mothers have the required knowledge and skills. For training and professional development on vitamin D, see what NICE says on vitamin D. subhead:Training in weight management Ensure health professionals, healthcare assistants and support workers have the skills to advise on the health benefits of weight management and risks of being overweight or obese before, during and after pregnancy, or after successive pregnancies.  Ensure they can advise women on their nutritional needs before, during and after pregnancy and can explain why it is important to have a balanced diet and to be moderately physically active.  Ensure they have behaviour change knowledge, skills and competencies. This includes being able to help people to identify how their behaviour is affecting their health, draw up an action plan, make the changes and maintain them. (See what NICE says on behaviour change.) Ensure they have the communication techniques needed to broach the subject of weight management in a sensitive manner. They should be able to give women practical advice on how to improve their diet and become more physically active. They should be able to tailor this advice to individual needs and know when to refer them for specialist care and support.  Ensure they have the knowledge and skills to help dispel common myths. This includes myths about what to eat and what not to eat during pregnancy and about weight loss in relation to breastfeeding.  Ensure they have knowledge, skills and competencies in group facilitation, are aware of the needs of minority ethnic groups and have knowledge of local services.  Ensure their training is regularly monitored and updated. subhead:Prescribing to breastfeeding womenEnsure health professionals and pharmacists who prescribe or dispense drugs to a breastfeeding mother consult supplementary sources (for example, the Drugs and Lactation Database [LactMed] ) or seek guidance from the UK Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service.

This recommendation should be read in conjunction with those below from NICE diagnostics guidance on high-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotype.Women should be screened for atypical red-cell alloantibodies in early pregnancy and again at 28 weeks, regardless of their RhD status.Pregnant women with clinically significant atypical red-cell alloantibodies should be offered referral to a specialist centre for further investigation and advice on subsequent antenatal management.If a pregnant woman is RhD-negative, consideration should be given to offering partner testing to determine whether the administration of anti-D prophylaxis is necessary.High-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotypeThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on high-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotype.High-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotype is recommended as a cost-effective option to guide antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin, provided that the overall cost of testing is \u00a324 or less. This will help reduce unnecessary use of a blood product in pregnant women, and conserve supplies by only using anti-D immunoglobulin for those who need it. Cost savings associated with high-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotype are sensitive to the unit cost of the test, additional pathway costs and implementation costs. Trusts adopting non-invasive prenatal testing should collect and monitor the costs and resource use associated with implementing testing to ensure that cost savings are achieved (see section 6.1 of diagnostics guidance 25).Routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxisThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis for women who are rhesus D negative.RAADP is recommended as a treatment option for all pregnant women who are RhD-negative and who are not known to be sensitised to the RhD antigen. When a decision has been made to give RAADP, the preparation with the lowest associated cost should be used. This cost should take into account the lowest acquisition cost available locally and costs associated with administration.

While NICE public health guidance 26 recommends 7 ppm, it states that when trying to identify pregnant women who smoke, it is best to use a low cut-off point to avoid missing someone who may need help to quit., to stop smoking services.Midwives should help women who do not smoke but register CO levels of 3 parts per million (ppm) or more to identify the source of CO and take further action as appropriate. Other sources include, for example, household or other secondhand smoke, heating appliances or traffic emissions. If a person declines help to stop smoking, leave the offer open. At subsequent contacts, offer the support again.

This should be provided by someone trained in breastfeeding management and should be delivered in a setting and style that best meets the woman s needs.During individual antenatal consultations GPs, obstetricians and midwives should encourage breastfeeding. They should pay particular attention to the needs of women who are least likely to breastfeed (for example, young women, those who have low educational achievement and those from disadvantaged groups).A midwife or health visitor trained in breastfeeding management should provide an informal group session in the last trimester of pregnancy. This should focus on how to breastfeed effectively by covering feeding position and how to attach the baby correctly. subhead:Advice for breastfeeding womenEnsure a mother can demonstrate how to position and attach the baby to the breast and can identify signs that the baby is feeding well. This should be achieved (and be documented) before she leaves hospital or the birth centre (or before the midwife leaves the mother after a home birth).Provide continuing and proactive breastfeeding support at home, recording all advice in the mother s hand-held records.Provide contact details for local voluntary organisations that can offer ongoing support to complement NHS breastfeeding services.Advise mothers that a healthy diet is important for everyone and that they do not need to modify their diet to breastfeed.Do not provide written materials in isolation but use them to reinforce face-to-face advice about breastfeeding. Show all breastfeeding mothers how to hand-express breast milk.Advise mothers that expressed milk can be stored for: up to 5 days in the main part of a fridge, at 4\u00baC or lower up to 2 weeks in the freezer compartment of a fridge up to 6 months in a domestic freezer, at minus 18\u00baC or lower.Advise mothers who wish to store expressed breast milk for less than 5 days that the fridge preserves its properties more effectively than freezing.Advise mothers who freeze their expressed breast milk to defrost it in the fridge and not to re-freeze it once thawed.

Health professionals should discuss the benefits and risks associated with the prescribed medication and encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding, if reasonable to do so. In most cases, it should be possible to identify a suitable medication which is safe to take during breastfeeding by analysing pharmokinetic and study data. Appendix 5 of the  British national formulary  should only be used as a guide as it does not contain quantitative data on which to base individual decisions.Health professionals should recognise that there may be adverse health consequences for both mother and baby if the mother does not breastfeed.

Telephone helplines and Internet support sites aimed at helping people to stop smoking.subhead:What action should they take?Identify people who smoke and advise them to stop smoking in one step as the best approach. See NICE s recommendations on stop smoking interventions and services, and the Department of Health s Stop smoking service delivery and monitoring guidance 2011/12. If someone does not want, is not ready or is unable to stop smoking in one step, ask if they would like to consider a harm-reduction approach. If they agree, help them to identify why they smoke, their smoking triggers and their smoking behaviour. Use this information to work through the harm-reduction approaches. Use professional judgement to suggest which approach(es) might be most suitable, based on the person s smoking behaviour, experience of previous quit attempts and their health and social circumstances. Briefly discuss the merits of each approach to help them choose. Ensure people know that licensed nicotine-containing products (such as nicotine patches, gum, or spray) make it is easier to cut down prior to stopping, or to reduce the amount they smoke. Explain that using these products also helps avoid compensatory smoking and increases the chances of stopping in the longer term.Recommend one or more licensed nicotine-containing products. If possible, supply or prescribe these products. Otherwise, encourage people to ask their GP or pharmacist for them, or tell them where they can buy the products themselves (see also offering licensed nicotine-containing products).Advise people that they can continue to use licensed nicotine-containing products in the long term, rather than risk relapsing after they have stopped, or reduced their smoking. If more intensive support is required, offer a referral to stop smoking services. These services provide pharmacotherapies and more comprehensive support and advice about harm reduction and stopping smoking in the longer term.  subhead:Supporting temporary abstinenceOffer people who want (or need) to abstain temporarily on a short-, medium- or longer-term basis advice on how to do this. Include information about the different types of licensed nicotine-containing products and how to use them. Where possible, prescribe them. (People might temporarily abstain in the short-term to comply with smokefree policies, for example, at work. Medium-term temporary abstinence may occur when admitted to hospital. Long-term temporary abstinence might occur during a custodial sentence.) Offer behavioural support to people who want (or need) to abstain temporarily. Support may be provided in one-to-one or group sessions by specialist services. It could include discussing why it is important to reduce the harm caused by smoking (to others as well as themselves). It could also include encouraging people to consider other times or situations when they could abstain.

Explain that the CO test will allow her to see a physical measure of her smoking and her exposure to other people s smoking. Ask her if she or anyone else in her household smokes. To help interpret the CO reading, establish whether she is a light or infrequent smoker. Other factors to consider include the time since she last smoked and the number of cigarettes smoked (and when) on the test day. (Note: CO levels fall overnight so morning readings may give low results.)Provide information (for example, a leaflet) about the risks to the unborn child of smoking when pregnant and the hazards of exposure to secondhand smoke for both mother and baby. Information should be available in a variety of formats.Explain about the health benefits of stopping for the woman and her baby. Advise her to stop \u2013 not just cut down.Explain that it is normal practice to refer all women who smoke for help to quit and that a specialist midwife or adviser will phone and offer her support. (Note: a specialist adviser needs to offer this support to minimise the risk of her opting out.)Refer all women who smoke, or have stopped smoking within the last 2 weeks, to evidence-based stop-smoking services. Also refer those with a CO reading of 7 ppm or above. (Note: light or infrequent smokers should also be referred, even if they register a lower reading \u2013 for example, 3 ppm.) If they have a high CO reading (more than 10 ppm) but say they do not smoke, advise them about possible CO poisoning and ask them to call the free Health and Safety Executive gas safety advice line on: 0800 300 363.Use local arrangements to make the appointment and, in case they want to talk to someone over the phone in the meantime, give the NHS Pregnancy Smoking Helpline number: 0800 1699 169. Also provide the local helpline number where one is available.If her partner or others in the household smoke, suggest they contact evidence-based stop-smoking services. If no one smokes, give positive feedback.At the next appointment, check if the woman took up her referral. If not, ask if she is interested in stopping smoking and offer another referral to the service.If she accepts the referral, use local arrangements to make the appointment and give the NHS Pregnancy Smoking Helpline number: 0800 1699 169. Also provide the local helpline number where one is available.If she declines the referral, accept the answer in an impartial manner, leave the offer of help open. Also highlight the flexible support that many evidence-based stop-smoking services offer pregnant women (for example, some offer home visits).If the referral was taken up, provide feedback. Review at subsequent appointments, as appropriate.Where appropriate, for each of the stages above record smoking status, CO level, whether a referral is accepted or declined and any feedback given. This should be recorded in the woman s hand-held record. If a hand-held record is not available locally, use local protocols to record this information.ContextSome women find it difficult to say that they smoke because the pressure not to smoke during pregnancy is so intense. This, in turn, makes it difficult to ensure they are offered appropriate support.A CO test is an immediate and non-invasive biochemical method for helping to assess whether or not someone smokes. However, it is unclear as to what constitutes the best cut-off point for determining smoking status. Some suggest a CO level as low as 3 parts per million (ppm), others use a cut-off point of 6\u201310 ppm.It is important to note that CO quickly disappears from expired breath (the level can fall by 50% in less than 4 hours). As a result, low levels of smoking may go undetected and may be indistinguishable from passive smoking. Conversely, environmental factors such as traffic emissions or leaky gas appliances may cause a high CO reading \u2013 as may lactose intolerance.When trying to identify pregnant women who smoke, it is best to use a low cut-off point to avoid missing someone who may need help to quit.subhead:Actions for others in the public, community and voluntary sectorsWho should take action?Those responsible for providing health and support services for the target group of women.

(The latter provide highly cost-effective interventions to help people stop smoking in one step. See NICE s recommendations on stop smoking interventions and services). Develop smoking cessation referral and treatment pathways to ensure a range of approaches and interventions are available to support people who opt for a harm-reduction approach (see harm-reduction approaches).   Ensure the providers of stop smoking and other behaviour-change services offer people who smoke the approaches outlined above. Ensure services are available in the community, as part of primary and secondary healthcare and on offer from local authorities.Develop activity and outcome measures to assess the performance of service providers involved in supporting people who are using harm-reduction approaches. Measures of activity could include: numbers attending the services (to allow comparison with the numbers attending before harm-reductions options were offered)  classifying the approaches used  client characteristics (such as demographic data, cigarette usage, level of dependency and previous quit attempts) type and amount of licensed nicotine-containing products supplied or prescribed, and over-the-counter sales of these products number of people setting a quit date.Ensure service specifications include a requirement that providers of stop smoking services offer licensed nicotine-containing products on a long-term basis to help prevent a relapse among people who have stopped smoking.

In order to achieve this, women should be advised to take a vitamin D supplement (10 micrograms of vitamin D per day), as found in the Healthy Start multivitamin supplement. Women who are not eligible for the Healthy Start benefit should be advised where they can buy the supplement. Particular care should be taken to enquire as to whether women at greatest risk are following advice to take this daily supplement. These include: women with darker skin (such as those of African, African\u2013Caribbean or South Asian family origin women who have limited exposure to sunlight, such as women who are housebound or confined indoors for long periods, or who cover their skin for cultural reasons.Testing vitamin D levelsHealth professionals should not routinely test people s vitamin D status unless:  they have symptoms of deficiency  they are considered to be at particularly high risk of deficiency (for example, they have very low exposure to sunlight)  there is a clinical reason to do so (for example, they have osteomalacia or have had a fall).Increase availability of vitamin D supplements for specific population groupsLocal authorities should ensure vitamin D supplements containing the recommended reference nutrient intake are widely available by:  Establishing arrangements with a range of settings to promote and distribute them.

Take into account views identified through community engagement (see strategies, policies and plans). See why we made the recommendation on local areas with high potential.subhead:Public transportIncrease physical activity associated with using public transport services. This includes encouraging use of these services by: Ensuring available services are reliable, particularly in rural areas where public transport may be more limited. Making information about public transport services accessible to people with visual and hearing impairments, for example provide spoken and visual announcements about destinations and stops on board services, and at stops and stations.  Making public transport physically accessible to everyone (see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility). Improving public transport to parks and other green and blue spaces.  See why we made the recommendations on public transport.subhead:Footways, footpaths and cycle routesEnsure new and refurbished footways, footpaths and cycle routes link to existing routes and improve the connectivity of the network as a whole. Aim to make it as easy as possible for people to walk, cycle or use other forms of active travel rather than making short journeys by car. This includes journeys between residential areas and: public transport stops and stations places of work public open spaces schools, colleges and early years settings healthcare services shops, and leisure sites.  Ensure footways, footpaths and cycle routes are convenient, safe and appealing to users, and are built and maintained to a high standard. For example, ensure: they are even and do not include any hazards, for example from tree roots, pot-holes, broken paving slabs or seasonal and weather-related obstructions they have enough lighting to make people feel secure they are free from permanent or temporary obstructions, where possible (see information on people with limited mobility in strategies, policies and plans)  they are not hidden by overgrown or poorly managed vegetation they have clear signs to help people find their way.Work in association with relevant third sector organisations and volunteers to plan and carry out this work. For more details, see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility and the Traffic signs manual. See why we made the recommendations on footways, footpaths and cycle routes.subhead:Streets and roadsEnsure pedestrians, cyclists and users of other modes of transport that involve physical activity are given the highest priority when developing or maintaining streets and roads. (This includes people with limited mobility.) Use 1 or more of the following methods: Re-allocate road space to support physically active modes of transport (for example, by widening footways and introducing cycle lanes). For more detail on designing these routes, see the recommendations on active travel in NICE s guidance on air pollution, and the Department for Transport s guidance on Shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Restrict motor vehicle access (for example, by closing or narrowing roads to reduce capacity).  Introduce road-user charging schemes. For more detail on charging schemes, see clean air and congestion charging zones in NICE s recommendations on air pollution. Introduce traffic-calming schemes to restrict vehicle speeds (using signage and changes to highway design). For more detail on traffic calming, see the recommendations on smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s guidance on air pollution, recommendations on promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s and Department for Transport s guidance on traffic calming.  See why we made the recommendations on streets and roads.subhead:Cycling infrastructureImprove cycling infrastructure using information from people who walk, cycle, and drive in the local area, including those with limited mobility. See strategies, policies and plans. Improvements may include: establishing cycle lanes, tracks and trails in line with best practice  installing secure cycle parking facilities in public places, on public transport and at public transport stops.

For example: Ensure footways:  have even, non-reflective anti-glare surfaces are free from unauthorised and unnecessary obstructions (whether permanent or temporary) including being free from pavement parking (see strategies, policies and plans).  - are set back from traffic, if possible (for example, by a grass verge). Ensure footways that have a kerb clearly define the kerb with a change in level (apart from pedestrian crossings). Ensure pedestrian crossings have flush kerbs and tactile paving (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces). Ensure signal-controlled crossings have tactile rotating cones and, if appropriate, an audible beep, and give enough time to cross the road safely. Ensure tactile paving is correctly installed and maintained where it is needed, for example at all crossing places, at the top and bottom of stairs, on the edge of railway platforms and on shared use routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on tactile paving surfaces). Ensure seating is provided at regular intervals along footways that are key walking routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility.  See why we made the recommendations for people with limited mobility.subhead:School, college and early years settingsImprove routes that children, young people and their families and carers use, or could use, for active travel to school, college and early years settings. Focus on improving safety, accessibility, connectivity, sustainability and appeal to users. Consider improving access routes to school, college and early years settings by: improving footways and pedestrian crossings (see above)  introducing measures to reduce vehicle speed (see smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s recommendations on air pollution) and promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s).

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate.

Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors).

Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.subhead:Responding to children and young peopleFind out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors).

Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve.

This includes local partnership agreements, local area play strategies and healthy school plans. Liaise with local partners to achieve this. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans (see recommendation below). This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Organise training courses for school travel plan advisers.subhead:Active and sustainable school travel plansContinue to encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as walking or cycling).Develop a school travel plan which has physical activity as a key aim, in line with existing guidance \u2013 see Making school travel plans work. Integrate it with the travel plans of other local schools and the local community (see above). The aim is to encourage children and young people to choose physically active modes of travel throughout their school career.Ensure schools provide suitable cycle and road safety training for all pupils.Encourage children and young people, especially those who live within a 2-mile radius of their school or other community facilities, to walk, cycle or use another mode of physically active travel to get there.Work with local authorities to map safe routes to school and to local play and leisure facilities. Take into account the views of pupils, parents and carers and consult with the local community. Overcome any barriers that are identified (for example, a lack of secure cycle parking).Involve children and young people, their parents and carers, the local community and external agencies in implementing the school travel plan. Use a mix of measures to promote it (for example, walking buses, walk and bike to school days). Work with the local authority school travel plan adviser to recruit volunteers on a long-term basis to help implement it.Set performance targets for school travel plans which are audited annually and which form part of delivery plans for local partnerships. Remedial action should be taken when agreed targets are not reached.Develop parents  and carers  awareness of the wider benefits of walking and cycling and other physically active modes of travel. For example, explain how it can improve children and young people s movement skills, social wellbeing, self-confidence and independence. Also explain how it can help children to explore and become more familiar (and at ease) with their local environment while, at the same time, being physically active.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The coordinator should have: specialist expertise in obesity prevention and community engagement the skills and experience to work across organisational boundaries   community health champions (volunteering with community or voluntary organisations) and other people who work directly with the community (such as health trainers and community engagement teams) to encourage local participation and support delivery of the programme. Coordinators should advise commissioners on contracts that support the local obesity agenda to ensure a  joined-up  approach. They should encourage commissioners to promote better integration between providers through the use of joint contracts and supply chain models that provide a range of local options. The aim is to tackle the wider determinants of obesity and support local people to make changes in their behaviour to prevent obesity.Directors of public health should ensure coordinators engage frontline staff (such as health visitors, environmental health officers and neighbourhood wardens) who can contribute to local action on obesity.Directors of public health should ensure frontline staff set aside dedicated time to deliver specific aspects of the obesity agenda and receive training to improve their understanding of the needs of the local community and improve their practical implementation skills. Coordinators and community engagement workers (such as health trainers and community development teams) should work together to develop and maintain a map of local people and assets that could support a community-wide approach to combating obesity. This includes:  community-based health workers such as health visitors, community pharmacists or weight management group leaders existing networks of volunteers and community champions, health trainers and community organisations such as religious groups, sports clubs, school governors or parent groups  people working in the community, such as the police, park wardens, leisure centre staff, active travel coordinators, school crossing patrol officers or school and workplace canteen staff  physical activity organisations and networks such as county sport physical activity partnerships unused open spaces or meeting places that could be used for community-based events and courses.  Coordinators and community engagement workers should jointly plan how they will work with population groups, or in geographic areas, with high levels of obesity. Plans should consider the motivations and characteristics of the target groups, in relation to obesity. Coordinators should also map where public, private, community and voluntary organisations are already working in partnership to improve health or on other relevant issues. Coordinators, supported by the director of public health, should encourage and support partnership working at both strategic and operational levels. They should ensure partner organisations are clear about their contribution and responsibilities.

Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. Apportion part of local transport funding to promote walking, cycling and other forms of travel that involve physical activity. The proportion allocated should be in line with growth targets for the use of these modes of transport.Ensure cycle tracks created under the Cycle Tracks Act 1984 are part of the definitive map (the legal record of public rights of way).subhead:Local transport plans \u2013 young peopleChildren and young people: key themes Promoting the benefits of physical activity and encouraging participation  Ensuring high-level strategic policy planning for children and young people supports the physical activity agenda  Consultation with, and the active involvement of, children and young people  The planning and provision of spaces, facilities and opportunities  The need for a skilled workforce  Promoting physically active and sustainable travel.What action should be taken?Ensure local transport and school travel plans continue to be fully aligned with other local authority plans which may impact on children and young people s physical activity. Liaise with local partnerships to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active.Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans. This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road. Consider how these policies can be improved to encourage physically active travel.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels.

The person has been receiving or will receive intensive management in a tier 3 service. (For more information on tier 3 services, see NHS England s report on joined up clinical pathways for obesity.) The person is generally fit for anaesthesia and surgery. The person commits to the need for long-term follow-up. The hospital specialist and/or bariatric surgeon should discuss the following with people who are severely obese if they are considering surgery to aid weight reduction: the potential benefits  the longer-term implications of surgery associated risks complications perioperative mortality.The discussion should also include the person s family, as appropriate. Choose the surgical intervention jointly with the person, taking into account:  the degree of obesity comorbidities the best available evidence on effectiveness and long-term effects the facilities and equipment available the experience of the surgeon who would perform the operation.Coordinate surgical care and follow-up around the child or young person and their family s needs. Comply with the approaches outlined in the Department of Heath s A Call to Action on Obesity in England.Ensure all young people have had a comprehensive psychological, educational, family and social assessment before undergoing bariatric surgery.Perform a full medical evaluation, including genetic screening or assessment before surgery to exclude rare, treatable causes of obesity.For guidance on preoperative tests for people aged 16 and 17 see the NICE pathway on preoperative tests.subhead:Resources and equipmentSurgery for obesity should be undertaken only by a multidisciplinary team that can provide paediatric expertise in:  preoperative assessment, including a risk-benefit analysis that includes preventing complications of obesity, and specialist assessment for eating disorder(s) information on the different procedures, including potential weight loss and associated risks regular postoperative assessment, including specialist dietetic and surgical follow-up management of comorbidities psychological support before and after surgery information on or access to plastic surgery (such as apronectomy) when appropriate access to suitable equipment, including scales, theatre tables, Zimmer frames, commodes, hoists, bed frames, pressure-relieving mattresses and seating suitable for children and young people undergoing bariatric surgery, and staff trained to use them.The surgeon in the multidisciplinary team should:  have had a relevant supervised training programme have specialist experience in bariatric surgery submit data for a national clinical audit scheme.

The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Emphasise that nicotine is not the major cause of damage to people s health from smoking tobacco, and that any risks from using licensed nicotine-containing products or other stop smoking pharmacotherapies are much lower than those of smoking.Recommend and offer: licensed nicotine-containing products (usually a combination of transdermal patches with a fast-acting product such as an inhalator, gum, lozenges or spray) to all people who smoke or varenicline (see what NICE says on varenicline) or bupropion as sole therapy as appropriate. Do not offer varenicline or bupropion to pregnant or breastfeeding women or people under the age of 18. Varenicline and bupropion can be used with caution in people with mental health problems (see the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) for varenicline and bupropion on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website for further information).Ideally, pregnant or breastfeeding women should stop smoking without using licensed nicotine-containing products, but if this is not possible, these products may be used.  For further information, see the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) for the individual drugs on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website.Encourage people who do not want (or do not feel able) to stop smoking completely (including pregnant or breastfeeding women) to use licensed nicotine-containing products to help reduce cravings to smoke during their stay or visit.If stop smoking pharmacotherapy is accepted, ensure that it is provided immediately. The person should remove nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches 24 hours before microvascular reconstructive surgery and surgery using vasopressin injections. When people are discharged from hospital ensure they have sufficient stop smoking pharmacotherapy to last at least 1 week or until their next contact with a stop smoking service. Encourage people who are already using an unlicensed nicotine-containing product (such as unlicensed electronic cigarettes) to switch to a licensed productAt the time of publication (November 2013), nicotine replacement therapy products were the only licensed nicotine-containing products. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has decided that all nicotine-containing products should be regulated once the European Commission s revised Tobacco Products Directive comes into effect in the UK (this is expected to be in 2016). In the meantime, the UK government will encourage applications for medicines licences for nicotine-containing products and will make best use of the flexibilities within the existing framework to enable licensed products to be available. This means that there may be both licensed and unlicensed products available until that date. For further details, see the MHRA website..

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child.Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute. What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable source. Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intakeThis is an edited extract from a recommendation that appears in Maternal and child nutrition  (NICE public health guidance 11).  of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments). Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy \u2013 see the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsNICE recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. See NICE s recommendations on obesity. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects. Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods.Explain to women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child. Explain that they should not try to reduce this risk by dieting while pregnant and that the risk will be managed by the health professionals caring for them during pregnancy.Offer women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more a referral to a dietician or appropriately trained health professional for assessment and personalised advice on healthy eating and how to be physically active. Encourage them to lose weight after pregnancy.subhead:Supporting women after childbirth During the 6-8-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache). Midwives and other health professionals should encourage women to breastfeed. They should reassure them that a healthy diet and regular, moderate-intensity physical activity and gradual weight loss will not adversely affect the ability to breastfeed or the quantity or quality of breast milk. Health professionals should give advice on recreational exercise from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In summary, this states that: If pregnancy and delivery are uncomplicated, a mild exercise programme consisting of walking, pelvic floor exercises and stretching may begin immediately. But women should not resume high-impact activity too soon after giving birth. After complicated deliveries, or lower segment caesareans, a medical care-giver should be consulted before resuming pre-pregnancy levels of physical activity, usually after the first check-up at 6-8 weeks after giving birth. Health professionals should also emphasise the importance of participating in physical activities, such as walking, which can be built into daily life. subhead:Community-based services Local authority leisure and community services should offer women with babies and children the opportunity to take part in a range of physical or recreational activities. This could include swimming, organised walks, cycling or dancing. Activities need to be affordable and available at times that are suitable for women with older children as well as those with babies. Where possible, affordable childcare (for example, a cr\u00e8che) should be provided and provision made for women who wish to breastfeed. Weight management groups and slimming clubs should adhere to the principles outlined at the beginning of this section. This includes giving advice about healthy eating and the importance of physical activity and using evidence-based behaviour-change techniques to motivate and support women to lose weight.Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should advise women that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both them and their unborn child during pregnancy. They should also explain that it will help them to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth \u2013 and could encourage the whole family to eat healthily and be physically active. Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should encourage those who have weight concerns before, during or after pregnancy to talk to a health professional such as a GP, practice nurse, dietician, health visitor or pharmacist. They should also advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice on healthy eating and physical activity from a reputable source. subhead:Professional skills Ensure health professionals, healthcare assistants and support workers have the skills to advise on the health benefits of weight management and risks of being overweight or obese before, during and after pregnancy, or after successive pregnancies. Ensure they can advise women on their nutritional needs before, during and after pregnancy and can explain why it is important to have a balanced diet and to be moderately physically active. Ensure they have behaviour change knowledge, skills and competencies. This includes being able to help people to identify how their behaviour is affecting their health, draw up an action plan, make the changes and maintain them. Ensure they have the communication techniques needed to broach the subject of weight management in a sensitive manner. They should be able to give women practical advice on how to improve their diet and become more physically active. They should be able to tailor this advice to individual needs and know when to refer them for specialist care and support. Ensure they have knowledge, skills and competencies in group facilitation, are aware of the needs of minority ethnic groups and have knowledge of local services. Ensure their training is regularly monitored and updated.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This should: include measures to maximise the opportunity for all employees to participate be based on consultation with staff and should ensure they are involved in planning and design, as well as monitoring activities, on an ongoing basis be supported by management and have dedicated resources set organisational goals and be linked to other relevant internal policies (for example, on alcohol, smoking, occupational health and safety, flexible working or travel) link to relevant national and local policies (for example, on health or transport).subhead:Implementing a physical activity programmeIntroduce and monitor an organisation-wide, multi-component programme to encourage and support employees to be physically active. This could be part of a broader programme to improve health. It could include: flexible working policies and incentive schemes policies to encourage employees to walk, cycle or use other modes of transport involving physical activity (to travel to and from work and as part of their working day) the dissemination of information (including written information) on how to be more physically active and on the health benefits of such activity. This could include information on local opportunities to be physically active (both within and outside the workplace) tailored to meet specific needs, for example, the needs of shift workers ongoing advice and support to help people plan how they are going to increase their levels of physical activity the offer of a confidential, independent health check administered by a suitably qualified practitioner and focused on physical activity.subhead:Components of the physical activity programmeEncourage employees to walk, cycle or use another mode of transport involving physical activity to travel part or all of the way to and from work (for example, by developing a travel plan).Help employees to be physically active during the working day by: where possible, encouraging them to move around more at work (for example, by walking to external meetings) putting up signs at strategic points and distributing written information to encourage them to use the stairs rather than lifts if they can providing information about walking and cycling routes and encouraging them to take short walks during work breaks encouraging them to set goals on how far they walk and cycle and to monitor the distances they cover.Take account of the nature of the work and any health and safety issues. For example, many people already walk long distances during the working day, while those involved in shift work may be vulnerable if walking home alone at night.subhead:Travel plans, showers and secure cycle parking In their role as employers, NHS organisations should set an example in developing public health policies to prevent and manage obesity by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy.

Investing in the health of employees can also bring business benefits such as reduced sickness absence, increased loyalty and better staff retention.NICE s recommendations aim to help employers and workplace health professionals prevent the diseases associated with a lack of physical activity. The recommendations alone will not reverse the current obesity epidemic or other health trends associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.What action should be taken?Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Public open spacesSee recommendations on making public spaces accessible and appealing in public open spaces.subhead:General environmental improvementsA national framework for actionCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem. Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. It also includes developing and implementing public sector workplace travel plans that incorporate physical activity \u2013 see physical activity programmes including active travel. Encourage and support employers in other sectors to do the same.Ensure the need for children and young people to be physically active is addressed. This includes providing adequate play spaces and opportunities for formal and informal physical activity.Audit bye-laws and amend those that prohibit physical activity in public spaces (such as those that prohibit ball games).Align all  planning gain  agreements with the promotion of heart health to ensure there is funding to support physically active travel.

When pre-eclampsia is not ruled-out using a PlGF based test result, the result should not be used to diagnose (rule-in) pre-eclampsia (see text box below). The Triage PlGF test and the Elecsys immunoassay sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, used with standard clinical assessment and subsequent clinical follow-up, show promise in helping to diagnose (rule-in) pre-eclampsia in women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia between 20 weeks and 34 weeks plus 6 days of gestation. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption for diagnosing pre-eclampsia in the NHS (see text box). Further research is recommended on using these tests in women with suspected pre-eclampsia to rule-in pre-eclampsia (see section 6.2 of the guidance).The DELFIA Xpress PlGF 1-2-3 test and BRAHMS sFlt-1 Kryptor/BRAHMS PlGF plus Kryptor PE ratio are not recommended for routine adoption in the NHS. Further research by the companies is needed to show the clinical effectiveness of these tests, including diagnostic accuracy and analytical validity. This guidance only considers using PlGF-based testing to help diagnose suspected pre-eclampsia. NICE is aware of ongoing research linking low PlGF levels and high sFlt-1/PlGF ratios (positive test results) with placental disease, but placental disease is beyond the scope of this guidance. Therefore, the recommendations in this guidance do not consider using PlGF-based testing for conditions other than suspected pre-eclampsia and this guidance is not intended to give advice on diagnosing or managing placental disease. If placental disease is suspected, additional clinical surveillance may be needed (see section 5.10 of the guidance).

The Department of Health has published health impact assessment tools to help organisations including, where relevant, government departments, assess the impact of policies on the health of the population. Policy goalsEnsure government policy is assessed for its impact on CVD. Ensure any such assessments are adequately incorporated into the policy making process. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAssess (in line with the Cabinet Office recommendations) all public policy and programmes for the potential impact (positive and negative) on CVD and other related chronic diseases. In addition, assess the potential impact on health inequalities. Assessments should be carried out using health and policy impact assessment and other similar, existing tools.Monitor the outcomes of policy and programmes after the assessment and use them to follow up and amend future plans.Make health impact assessment mandatory in specific scenarios. (Note that strategic environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment and regulatory impact assessment are already mandatory in certain contexts.)See also the recommendations on local and regional health impact assessments.subhead:MonitoringContextCVD is responsible for around 33% of the observed gap in life expectancy among people living in areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators compared with those living elsewhere in England. Independent monitoring, using a full range of available data, is vital when assessing the need for additional measures to address such health inequalities, including those related to CVD. Policy goalEnsure all appropriate data are available for monitoring and analysis to inform CVD prevention policy. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEnsure data on CVD prevention is available for scrutiny by the public health community as a whole.Ensure new econometric data (including pooled consumer purchasing data) are rapidly made available by industry for monitoring and analysis by independent agencies.Use population surveys (including the National diet and nutrition survey [NDNS] and the Low income diet and nutrition survey [LIDNS]) and data from all relevant sources to monitor intake of nutrients for all population groups. (Sources include: the Department of Health, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Office for National Statistics, the Public Health Observatories, academic and other researchers.)Monitor the intake of salt, trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids among different population groups and report the findings for those groups.Support the National diet and nutrition survey and the Low income diet and nutrition survey. Ensure the CVD module (including lipid profile measures) routinely appears in the Health surveys for England.Develop an international public health information system (resembling GLOBALink) for CVD prevention and use it to ensure widespread dissemination of these data.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The burden of diet-related disease has grown considerably since CAP was first implemented. CAP reform offers a significant opportunity to address the burden of CVD. However, there are still a number of significant  distortions  in relation to certain food prices and production processes which potentially increase the burden of disease. Further reform should aim to remove these distortions to promote health and wellbeing and to provide a basis for UK government action to prevent CVDLloyd Williams F, Mwatsama M, Birt C et al. (2008) Estimating the cardiovascular mortality burden attributable to the European Common Agricultural Policy on dietary saturated fats. Geneva: World Health Organization. Lock K, Pomerleau J (2005) Fruit and vegetable policy in the European Union: its effect on cardiovascular disease. Brussels: European Health Network.. The CAP has two main  pillars : market measures (first pillar) and rural development policy (second pillar). Recent CAP reform has shifted money from the first to the second pillar which now focuses more on  public goods . However, health has not been formally recognised as a  public good . CAP reforms have begun to address this issue, but a clearer focus on CVD and its antecedents (that is, the production of foods high in fat, sugar or salt) is needed.subhead:Policy goalsEnsure promoting health and reducing disease is made an explicit part of the CAP s  public goods  so that European money promotes the wellbeing of EU citizens. (The scope of what are regarded as  European public goods  in the EU is broader than the strict definition of a  public good  used by some economists.)Ensure CAP spending takes adequate account of its potential impact on CVD risk factors and is used in a way that optimises the public health outcomes. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsNegotiate at EU and national level to ensure the CAP takes account of public health issues. Health benefits should be an explicit, legitimate outcome of CAP spending. This can be achieved through formal recognition of health as a  public good .Progressively phase out payments under  pillar one  so that all payments fall under  pillar two . This will allow for better protection of health, climate and the environment. It will also improve and stimulate economic growth.Encourage the principle that future  pillar two  funds should reward or encourage the production of highly nutritious foods such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains and leaner meats.Negotiate to ensure the European Commission s impact assessment procedure takes cardiovascular health and other health issues into account. (Impact assessment is part of the European Commission s strategic planning and programming cycle.)SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Responding to children and young peopleIdentify local factors that may affect whether or not children and young people are physically active by regularly consulting with them, their parents and carers.Find out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability.

This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers.

Provide examples of local opportunities.Encourage parents and carers to get involved in physical activities with their children.Encourage parents and carers to complete at least some local journeys (or some part of a local journey) with young children using a physically active mode of travel. This should take place on most days of the week. The aim is to establish physically active travel (such as walking or cycling) as a life-long habit from an early age. Parents and carers should also be encouraged to allow their children to become more independent, by gradually allowing them to walk, cycle or use another physically active mode of travel for short distances.Act as a role model by incorporating physical activity into daily life. For example, opt for travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling), use the stairs and regularly participate in recreational activities or sport.Promote physically active travel as an option for all the family.

This includes local partnership agreements, local area play strategies and healthy school plans. Liaise with local partners to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active. Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans (see recommendation below). This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Organise training courses for school travel plan advisers.Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road.

Integrate it with the travel plans of other local schools and the local community (see above). The aim is to encourage children and young people to choose physically active modes of travel throughout their school career.Ensure schools provide suitable cycle and road safety training for all pupils.Encourage children and young people, especially those who live within a 2-mile radius of their school or other community facilities, to walk, cycle or use another mode of physically active travel to get there.Work with local authorities to map safe routes to school and to local play and leisure facilities. Take into account the views of pupils, parents and carers and consult with the local community. Overcome any barriers that are identified (for example, a lack of secure cycle parking).Involve children and young people, their parents and carers, the local community and external agencies in implementing the school travel plan. Use a mix of measures to promote it (for example, walking buses, walk and bike to school days). Work with the local authority school travel plan adviser to recruit volunteers on a long-term basis to help implement it.Set performance targets for school travel plans which are audited annually and which form part of delivery plans for local partnerships. Remedial action should be taken when agreed targets are not reached.Develop parents  and carers  awareness of the wider benefits of walking and cycling and other physically active modes of travel. For example, explain how it can improve children and young people s movement skills, social wellbeing, self-confidence and independence. Also explain how it can help children to explore and become more familiar (and at ease) with their local environment while, at the same time, being physically active.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Find out about any previous CVD prevention initiatives that have been run (including any positive or negative experiences).Consider how existing policies relating to food, tobacco control and physical activity, including those developed by the local authority, may impact on the prevalence of CVD locally.Gauge the community s level of knowledge of, and beliefs about, CVD risk factors. This includes beliefs that smoking is the only solace in life for people with little money, or that only people who have a lot of money eat salad.Gauge how confident people in the community are that they can change their behaviour to reduce the risks of CVD. (See what NICE says on behaviour change.)Identify groups of the population who are disproportionately affected by CVD and develop strategies with them to address their needs.Take into account the community s exposure to risk factors (factors currently facing adults and those emerging for children and younger people).subhead:Programme developmentDevelop a population-based approach.Ensure a  programme theory  is developed and used to underpin the programmePawson R (2001) Evidence based policy: 2.

This includes the NHS Health Checks programme.Work closely with regional and local authorities and other organisations to promote policies which are likely to encourage healthier eating, tobacco control and increased physical activity. Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups).When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations in this guidance, and the NICE guidance on  behaviour change community engagement  maternal and child nutrition physical activity smoking.Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors. Media campaigns should be based on an acknowledged theoretical framework.subhead:ResourcesEnsure the programme lasts a minimum of 5 years (while subject to annual evaluation reports) to maximise its potential impact.Produce a long-term plan \u2013 and gain political commitment \u2013 for funding to ensure the programme has adequate resources and is sustainable beyond the end of the research or evaluation period.Ensure the programme is adequately staffed.

Dedicated resources should be allocated for action.subhead:Strategy for senior managers and budget holdersLocal authorities should set an example in developing policies to prevent obesity in their role as employers, by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy. On-site catering should promote healthy food and drink choices (for example by signs, posters, pricing and positioning of products).Local authorities (including planning, transport and leisure services) should engage with the local community, to identify environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating. This should involve:  an audit, with the full range of partners including commissioners of health services, residents, businesses and institutions  assessing (ideally by doing a health impact assessment) the affect of their policies on the ability of their communities to be physically active and eat a healthy diet; the needs of subgroups should be considered because barriers may vary by, for example, age, gender, social status, ethnicity, religion and whether an individual has a disability.Barriers identified in this way should be addressed.Local authorities should facilitate links between health professionals and other organisations to ensure that local public policies improve access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity. Local authorities, through local partnerships, should encourage all local shops, supermarkets and caterers to promote healthy food and drink, for example by signs, posters, pricing and positioning of products, in line with existing guidance and (in England) with the local obesity strategy.subhead:Use of public money to buy food and drink in private sector venuesWhen public money is used to procure food and drink in venues outside the direct control of the public sector, ensure those venues provide a range of affordable healthier options (including from vending machines). Ideally, the healthier options should be cheaper than the less healthy alternatives.

If there is a risk of, or there are concerns about, suspected child maltreatment, follow local safeguarding protocols.  If there is a risk of self-harm or suicide: assess whether the woman has adequate social support and is aware of sources of help arrange help appropriate to the level of risk inform all relevant care professionals (including the GP and those identified in the care plan (see develop a care plan)) advise the woman, and her partner, family or carer, to seek further help if the situation deteriorates.

Ensure assessment of physical activity and the delivery of, and follow up on, brief advice (see brief advice for adults) are built into local long-term disease management strategies. Highlight physical activity as an independent modifiable risk factor for many conditions (see physical activity: definition and current UK recommendations).

The strategy should ensure: there are local indoor and outdoor opportunities for physical activity where children and young people feel safe individuals responsible for increasing physical activity are aware of national and local government strategies as well as local plans for increasing physical activity partnership working is developed and supported within local physical activity networks physical activity partnerships establish and deliver multi-component interventions involving schools, families and communities. (Partners may include: schools, colleges, out-of-schoolOut-of-school services are defined as those providing activities that take place outside the formal school day, possibly as part of extended school services. They could involve using school facilities during the evening, weekends and school holidays. services, children s centres and play services, youth services, further education institutions, community clubs and groups and private sector providers) local factors that help children and young people to be (or which prevent them from being) physically active are identified and acted upon local transport and school travel plans are coordinated so that all local journeys can be carried out using a physically active mode of travel. See transport and physical activity. Ensure physical activity initiatives aimed at children and young people are regularly evaluated. Evaluations should measure uptake among different groups (for example, among those with disabilities or from different ethnic backgrounds). Any changes in physical activity, physical skills and health outcomes should be recorded. Identify a senior council member to be a champion for children and young people s physical activity. They should: promote the importance of encouraging physical activity as part of all council portfolios ensure physical activity is a key priority when developing local authority programmes and targets promote partnership working with council member leads of relevant departments (for example, transport, leisure and health) explain to the public the local authority s role in promoting physical activity.subhead:Developing physical activity plans for childrenIdentify groups of local children and young people who are unlikely to participate in at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. Work with the public health observatory, schools and established community partnerships and voluntary organisations to achieve this.Involve these children and young people in the design, planning and delivery of physical activity opportunities, using the information gathered.Consult with different groups of children and young people and their families on a regular basis to understand the factors that help or prevent them from being physically active. Pay particular attention to those who are likely to be less physically active. Ensure children and young people from different socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are actively involved in the provision of activities. Also ensure those with a disability (or who are living with a family member who has a disability) are actively involved.Use the information gathered to increase opportunities for children and young people to be physically active and to plan dedicated programmes that tackle any inequalities in provision. For further recommendations on community engagement, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement.subhead:Planning the provision of spaces and facilities for children Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels.Align actions to promote physical activity with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see NICE s recommendations on obesity: working with local communities).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instruction for activities aimed at children and young peopleEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment. (For example, advice on how they might help their child become involved in an activity.)

Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.The recommendations below should be implemented before those in CVD programme resources, leadership and evaluation.subhead:Good practice principlesEnsure a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programme comprises intense, multi-component interventions.Ensure it takes into account issues identified in this guidance. See also NICE s recommendations on cardiovascular disease prevention.Ensure it includes initiatives aimed at the whole population (such as local policy and regulatory initiatives) which complement existing programmes aimed at individuals at high risk of CVD.Ensure it is sustainable for a minimum of 5 years.Ensure appropriate time and resources are allocated for all stages, including planning and evaluation.subhead:PreparationGain a good understanding of the prevalence and incidence of CVD in the community. Find out about any previous CVD prevention initiatives that have been run (including any positive or negative experiences).Consider how existing policies relating to food, tobacco control and physical activity, including those developed by the local authority, may impact on the prevalence of CVD locally.Gauge the community s level of knowledge of, and beliefs about, CVD risk factors. This includes beliefs that smoking is the only solace in life for people with little money, or that only people who have a lot of money eat salad.Gauge how confident people in the community are that they can change their behaviour to reduce the risks of CVD. See NICE s recommendations on behaviour change.Identify groups of the population who are disproportionately affected by CVD and develop strategies with them to address their needs.Take into account the community s exposure to risk factors (factors currently facing adults and those emerging for children and younger people).subhead:Programme developmentDevelop a population-based approach. Ensure a  programme theory  is developed and used to underpin the programmeEvidence based policy: 2. The promise of  realist synthesis . This should cover the reasons why particular actions are expected to have particular outcomes.Ensure the programme helps address local targets and tackles health inequalities.Link the programme with existing strategies for targeting people at particularly high risk of CVD and take account of ongoing, accredited screening activities by GPs and other healthcare professionals. This includes the NHS Health Checks programme.Work closely with local authorities and other organisations covering specific areas to promote policies which are likely to encourage healthier eating, tobacco control and increased physical activity. Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups).When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations made within this guidance. Also see what NICE says on smoking, behaviour change, community engagement and diet. Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors.

Ask if anyone else in the household smokes (this includes her partner if she has one).Provide information about the risks of smoking to an unborn child and the benefits of stopping for both mother and baby.Address any concerns she and her partner or family may have about stopping smoking and offer personalised information, advice and support on how to stop.If partners or other family members are present at the first face-to-face meeting, encourage those who smoke to quit. If they smoke but are not at the meeting, ask the pregnant woman to suggest they contact evidence-based stop-smoking services and provide her with contact details (for example, telephone and address card).Provide the woman with intensive and ongoing support (brief interventions alone are unlikely to be sufficient) throughout pregnancy and beyond. This includes regularly monitoring her smoking status using CO tests. The latter may encourage her to try to quit \u2013 and can also be a useful way of providing positive feedback once a quit attempt has been made.Biochemically validate that the woman has quit on the date she set and 4 weeks after. Where possible, use urine or saliva cotinine tests, as these are more accurate than CO tests and can detect exposure over the past few days rather than hours. When carrying out these tests, check whether the woman is using NRT as this may raise her cotinine levels. Note: no measure can be 100% accurate. Some people may smoke so infrequently \u2013 or inhale so little \u2013 that their intakes cannot reliably be distinguished from that due to passive smoking.If the woman says that she has stopped smoking, but the CO test reading is higher than 10 ppm, advise her about possible CO poisoning and ask her to call the free Health and Safety Executive gas safety advice line on: 0800 300 363. However, it is more likely that she is still smoking and any further questions must be phrased sensitively to encourage a frank discussion.If she stopped smoking in the 2 weeks prior to her maternity booking appointment, continue to provide support, in line with the recommendations above and evidence-based stop-smoking services practice protocols.Record the method used to quit smoking, including whether or not she received help and support. Follow up 12 months after the date she set to quit.Establish links with contraceptive services, fertility clinics and ante- and postnatal services so that everyone working in those organisations knows about local evidence-based stop-smoking services. Ensure they understand what these services offer and how to refer people to them.ContextStudies have shown that the following interventions are effective in helping women who are pregnant to quit smoking: cognitive behaviour therapy motivational interviewing structured self-help and support from evidence-based stop-smoking services.In addition, in other countries the provision of incentives to quit has been shown to be effective with this group (research is required to see whether it would work in the UK).Interventions using a  stages of change  approach have had mixed success. (In some studies the approach was effective; in others it was no better than the control.)

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child. Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute.What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable sourceReputable sources of information and advice about diet and physical activity for women before, during and after pregnancy include:  The pregnancy book  (Department of Health (2009) The pregnancy book. London: Department of Health),  Birth to five  (Department of Health (2009) Birth to five. London: Department of Health) and the  Eat well guide . .Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments).Dispel any myths about what and how much to eat during pregnancy. For example, advise that there is no need to  eat for two  or to drink full-fat milk. Explain that energy needs do not change in the first 6 months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last 3 months (and then only by around 200 calories per day).Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy (see the RCOG advice on physical activity):  recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial  the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness  if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsThe NICE guideline on obesity prevention (CG43) recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects.Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods. Measure weight and height at the first contact with the pregnant woman, being sensitive to any concerns she may have about her weight. If these data are not available at their first booking appointment, then the midwife should do this. Do not rely on self-reported measures of weight and height. Clearly explain why this information is needed and how it will be used to plan her care. Weigh her in light clothing using appropriate, calibrated weighing scales that are regularly checked. Calculate BMI by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m2), or use the BMI calculator after measuring and weighing. Use BMI percentile charts for pregnant women under 18 years, as a BMI measure alone does not take growth into account and is inappropriate for this age group.Weight, height and BMI should be recorded in notes, the woman s hand-held record and the patient information system. If a hand-held record is not available, use local protocols to record this information.Do not weigh women repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. Only weigh again if clinical management can be influenced or if nutrition is a concern.subhead:Supporting women after childbirthUse the 6\u20138-week postnatal check as an opportunity to discuss the woman s weight. Ask those who are overweight, obese or who have concerns about their weight if they would like any further advice and support now \u2013 or later. If they say they would like help later, they should be asked whether they would like to make an appointment within the next 6 months for advice and support.During the 6\u20138-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache).Health professionals should advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice from a reputable source. Women who want support to lose weight should be given details of appropriate community-based services.See also what NICE says on physical activity.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Further weight loss, to achieve a BMI within the healthy range (between 24.9 and 18.5 kg/m2) should also be encouraged, using evidence-based behaviour change techniques. Losing weight to within this range may be difficult and women will need to be motivated and supported.Health professionals should encourage women to check their weight and waist measurement periodically or, as a simple alternative, check the fit of their clothes. Health professionals should offer a weight loss support programme involving diet and physical activity. The programme should follow the principles of good practice, as outlined in self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes.Health professionals should offer specific dietary advice in preparation for pregnancy, including the need to take daily folic acid supplements. This includes professionals working in pre-conception clinics, fertility clinics, sexual and reproductive health services and children s centres.Explain to women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child.

They will provide a personalised assessment, advice about diet and physical activity and advice on behaviour change strategies such as goal setting. Women who are not yet ready to lose weight should be provided with information about where they can get support when they are ready. Use evidence-based behaviour change techniques to motivate and support women to lose weight. Encourage breastfeeding and advise women that losing weight by eating healthily and taking regular exercise will not affect the quantity or quality of their milk.Changing behaviourEvidence-based behaviour change advice includes: understanding the short, medium and longer-term consequences of people s health-related behaviour helping people to feel positive about the benefits of health-enhancing behaviours and changing their behaviours recognising how people s social contexts and relationships may affect their behaviour helping plan people s changes in terms of easy steps over time identifying and planning situations that might undermine the changes people are trying to make and plan explicit  if\u2013then  coping strategies to prevent relapse.For more information see what NICE says on behaviour change.See also community and leisure services and weight management programmes, and NICE s recommendations on physical activity, diabetes in pregnancy, antenatal care and obesity.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Maternal and child nutrition quality standard2Structured weight-loss programmeSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

(For existing advice on healthy eating see NHS Choices.) Avoid extreme physical activity or dietary behaviours (such as obsessively exercising or aiming to avoid all carbohydrates) because they are difficult to sustain and may not be accompanied by wider improvements in health.  Identify perceptions, habits or situations that may undermine efforts to maintain a healthy weight or prevent excess weight gain in the long term, and offer practical examples of helpful alternatives. These may include: drinking water instead of drinks containing free sugars (including sports drinks) while being physically active not overestimating how much physical activity is being done  avoiding overeating after being physically active maintaining healthier physical activity and dietary habits most days (including at weekends) and during holidays (for example, the school summer holiday)  avoiding giving sweet treats as a reward or giving them regularly as gifts checking food and drink labels as a guide to appropriate portion sizes being aware that even food and drinks perceived as healthy (such as olive oil, fruit juice, nuts) can contribute to weight gain if large amounts are consumed.For more information see what NICE says on diet and physical activity.subhead:Parents and carers of children and young peopleIn addition to the advice on physical activity and diet, encourage parents, carers and everyone in regular contact with children and young people to:  Encourage and support them to be active at every opportunity (such as active play, travel, sport or leisure activities).

In addition, everyone should be encouraged to: Reduce the overall energy density of the diet. Practical ways to achieve this may include:  reducing how often energy dense foods and drinks (such as fried foods, biscuits, savoury snacks, confectionery and drinks made with full fat milk or cream) are eaten substituting energy dense items with foods and drinks with a lower energy density (such as fruit and vegetables or water)  using food and drink labels to choose options lower in fat and sugar choosing smaller portions or avoiding additional servings of energy dense foods.  Limit consumption of energy-dense food and drinks prepared outside the home, particularly fast or takeaway foods.  Avoid sugary drinks (including carbonated drinks, sports drinks, squashes and any other drinks that contain free sugars). Everyone should be encouraged to choose water or other drinks that do not contain free sugars. Other suitable drinks may include coffee, tea or drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners, such as diet versions of carbonated drinks or squashes. Reduce total fat intake. Practical ways of doing this may include choosing lower fat options of the main sources of fat in the diet, reducing portion size or frequency of consumption of foods high in fat (such as meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, fats and oils, and baked foods such as pizza, biscuits and cakes).  Eat breakfast but do not increase overall daily energy intake. Breakfast choices should reflect existing healthy eating advice. Practical ways to achieve this may include opting for unsweetened wholegrain cereals or bread, lower fat milk and a portion of fruit.  Increase the proportion of high fibre or wholegrain foods eaten. Practical ways to do this may include: choosing wholemeal bread and pasta and wholegrain rice instead of  white  versions opting for higher-fibre foods (such as oats, fruit and vegetables, beans, peas and lentils) in place of food and drinks high in fat or sugar.  Limit intake of meat and meat products. Follow existing advice from NHS Choices to eat no more than 70 g of red and processed meat a day.
