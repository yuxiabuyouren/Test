In children older than 6 months do not use height of body temperature alone to identify those with serious illness. Do not use duration of fever to predict the likelihood of serious illness. However, children with a fever lasting more than 5 days should be assessed for Kawasaki disease (see Kawasaki disease). Assess children with fever for signs of dehydration. Look for: prolonged capillary refill time abnormal skin turgor abnormal respiratory pattern weak pulse cool extremities.subhead:Red \u2013 high riskRecognise that children with any of the following symptoms or signs are in a high-risk group for serious illness: pale/mottled/ashen/blue skin, lips or tongue no response to social cues appearing ill to a healthcare professional does not wake or if roused does not stay awake weak, high-pitched or continuous cry grunting respiratory rate greater than 60 breaths per minute moderate or severe chest indrawing reduced skin turgor bulging fontanelle.Recognise that children younger than 3 months with a temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher are in a high-risk group for serious illness. subhead:Amber \u2013 intermediate risk or higherRecognise that children with any of the following symptoms or signs are in at least an intermediate-risk group for serious illness: pallor of skin, lips or tongue reported by parent or carer  not responding normally to social cues no smile wakes only with prolonged stimulation decreased activity nasal flaring dry mucous membranes poor feeding in infants reduced urine output rigors. Recognise that a capillary refill time of 3 seconds or longer is an intermediate-risk group marker for serious illness ( amber  sign).  Recognise that children aged 3\u20136 months with a temperature of 39\u00b0C or higher are in at least an intermediate-risk group for serious illness.  Recognise that children with tachycardia are in at least an intermediate-risk group for serious illness.
