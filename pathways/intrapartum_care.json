This will help reduce unnecessary use of a blood product in pregnant women, and conserve supplies by only using anti-D immunoglobulin for those who need it. Cost savings associated with high-throughput non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal RHD genotype are sensitive to the unit cost of the test, additional pathway costs and implementation costs. Trusts adopting non-invasive prenatal testing should collect and monitor the costs and resource use associated with implementing testing to ensure that cost savings are achieved (see section 6.1 of diagnostics guidance 25).Routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxisThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis for women who are rhesus D negative.RAADP is recommended as a treatment option for all pregnant women who are RhD-negative and who are not known to be sensitised to the RhD antigen.

Check equipment and count swabs and needles before and after the procedure. Good lighting is essential to see and identify the structures involved. Ensure that difficult trauma is repaired by an experienced practitioner in theatre under regional or general anaesthesia. Insert an indwelling catheter for 24 hours to prevent urinary retention. Ensure that good anatomical alignment of the wound is achieved and that consideration is given to the cosmetic results. Carry out rectal examination after completing the repair to ensure that suture material has not been accidentally inserted through the rectal mucosa. After completion of the repair, document an accurate detailed account covering the extent of the trauma, the method of repair and the materials used.

This is because women who have had a caesarean section are less likely to start breastfeeding in the first few hours after the birth, but, when breastfeeding is established, they are as likely to continue as women who have a vaginal birth. Women who are recovering well after caesarean section and who do not have complications can eat and drink when they feel hungry or thirsty.Removal of the urinary bladder catheter should be carried out once a woman is mobile after a regional anaesthetic and not sooner than 12 hours after the last epidural  top up  dose.Routine respiratory physiotherapy does not need to be offered to women after a caesarean section under general anaesthesia, because it does not improve respiratory outcomes such as coughing, phlegm, body temperature, chest palpation and auscultatory changes.In addition to general postnatal care, women who have had a caesarean section should be provided with: specific care related to recovery after caesarean section  care related to management of other complications during pregnancy or childbirth.Caesarean section wound care should include: removing the dressing 24 hours after the caesarean section  specific monitoring for fever  assessing the wound for signs of infection (such as increasing pain, redness or discharge), separation or dehiscence encouraging the woman to wear loose, comfortable clothes and cotton underwear  gently cleaning and drying the wound daily if needed, planning the removal of sutures or clips.For more recent recommendations on wound care, see wound cleansing and dressing after surgery in terms of preventing and treating surgical site infections.Healthcare professionals caring for women who have had a caesarean section and who have urinary symptoms should consider the possible diagnosis of: urinary tract infection stress incontinence (occurs in about 4% of women after caesarean section)  urinary tract injury (occurs in about 1 per 1,000 caesarean section).Healthcare professionals caring for women who have had a caesarean section and who have heavy and/or irregular vaginal bleeding should consider that this is more likely to be due to endometritis than retained products of conception.Women who have had a caesarean section are at increased risk of thromboembolic disease (both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), so healthcare professionals need to pay particular attention to women who have chest symptoms (such as cough or shortness of breath) or leg symptoms (such as painful swollen calf).For more information, see diagnosing venous thromboembolism in NICE s recommendations on venous thromboembolism.Healthcare professionals caring for women who have had a caesarean section should inform women that after a caesarean section they are not at increased risk of difficulties with breastfeeding, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, dyspareunia and faecal incontinence.While women are in hospital after having a caesarean section, give them the opportunity to discuss with healthcare professionals the reasons for the caesarean section and provide both verbal and printed information about birth options for any future pregnancies. If the woman prefers, provide this at a later date.NICE has written information for the public explaining the guidance on caesarean section.Length of hospital stay is likely to be longer after a caesarean section (an average of 3\u20134 days) than after a vaginal birth (average 1\u20132 days). However, women who are recovering well, are apyrexial and do not have complications following caesarean section should be offered early discharge (after 24 hours) from hospital and follow-up at home, because this is not associated with more infant or maternal readmissions.Women who have had a caesarean section should resume activities such as driving a vehicle, carrying heavy items, formal exercise and sexual intercourse once they have fully recovered from the caesarean section (including any physical restrictions or distracting effect due to pain).

During the service period or shift reassess differences between the midwifery staff needed and the number available when: there is unexpected variation in demand for maternity services or midwifery care (for example, if there is an unexpected increase in the number of women in established labour) there is unplanned staff absence during the shift or service women and babies need extra support or specialist input  a midwifery red flag event has occurred (see midwifery red flag events).Consider the following when undertaking the assessment: risk factors and risk categorisation, acuity and dependency of each woman and baby in the service (use the information in consider risk, acuity and dependency of each woman and baby when assessing maternity care needs as a prompt) environmental factors (use the information in examples of environmental factors to consider when assessing maternity care needs as a prompt) time taken to perform the necessary midwifery care activities (use the information in examples of maternity care activities that affect midwifery staffing as a prompt).Follow escalation plans if the number of midwives available is different from the number of midwives needed (see develop escalation plans). Service cancellations or closures should be the last option. Take into account the potential of cancellations or closures to limit women s choice and to affect maternity service provision and the reputation of the organisation.If a midwifery red flag event occurs (see midwifery red flag events for examples), the midwife in charge of the service or shift should be notified. The midwife in charge should determine whether midwifery staffing is the cause, and the action that is needed. Action may include allocating additional midwifery staff to the service.

Undertake a systematic process to calculate the midwifery staffing establishment. The process (or parts of the process) could be supported by a NICE endorsed toolkit (if available). The process should contain the following components. Use historical data about the number and care needs of women who have accessed maternity services over a sample period (for example, the past 12 months or longer). Estimate the total maternity care hours needed over the sample period based on a risk categorisation of women and babies in the service. This should consider the following: risk factors, acuity and dependency (see consider risk, acuity and dependency of each woman and baby when assessing maternity care needs for examples) the estimated time taken to perform all routine maternity care activities (see part A in examples of maternity care activities that affect midwifery staffing) the estimated time taken to perform additional activities (see part B in examples of maternity care activities that affect midwifery staffing). Divide the total number of maternity care hours by the number of women in the time period to determine the historical average maternity care hours needed per woman. Use data on the number of women who are currently accessing the maternity service and the trend in new bookings to predict the number of women in the service in the next 6 months.  Multiply the predicted number of women in the service over the next 6 months by the historical average maternity care hours needed per woman to determine the predicted total maternity care hours needed over the next 6 months.  From the total predicted maternity care hours, identify the hours of midwife time and skill mix to deliver the maternity care activities that are required. Take account of: environmental factors including local service configuration (see examples of environmental factors to consider when assessing maternity care needs) the range of staff available, such as maternity support workers, registered nurses or GPs, and the activities that can be safely delegated to or provided by them (see examples of staffing factors to consider when assessing maternity care needs). Allow for the following: one-to-one care during established labour (unless already accounted for in the historical data) more than one-to-one care during established labour if circumstances require it (unless already accounted for in the historical data) any staffing ratios for other stages of care that have been developed locally depending on the local service configuration and the needs of individual women and babies the locally defined rate of uplift (for example, to allow for annual leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, study leave, special leave and sickness absence).   Divide the total midwife hours by 26 to give the average number of midwife hours needed per week over the next 6 months. Divide the weekly average by the number of hours for a full time working week to determine the number of whole time equivalents needed for the midwife establishment over the next 6 months.  Convert the number of whole time equivalents into the annual midwife establishment.See systematic process to calculate the midwifery staffing establishment in the guideline for a summary of this process. Base the number of whole-time equivalents on registered midwives, and do not include the following in the calculations: registered midwives undertaking a Local Supervising Authority Programme registered midwives with supernumerary status (this may include newly qualified midwives, or midwives returning to practice) student midwives the proportion of time specialist and consultant midwives who are part of the establishment spend delivering contracted specialist work (for example, specialist midwives in bereavement roles) the proportion of time midwives who are part of the establishment spend coordinating a service, for example the labour ward. Use professional judgement at each stage of the calculation and when checking the calculations for the midwifery staffing establishment.Base the midwife roster on the midwifery staffing establishment calculations, taking into account any predictable peaks in activity, and risk categorisation of women and babies (for example, during the day when midwife activities are likely to be planned, or for a service dealing with higher risk category women and babies).Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2One-to-one careSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The available evidence suggests that the device can reliably exclude amniotic fluid leak as a cause of vaginal wetness in pregnancy, avoiding the need for a speculum examination and its associated discomforts. Using the device in the community could prevent unnecessary referrals to secondary care antenatal day units or maternity triage services for speculum examinations, releasing clinical time.The Vision ALD should be considered for use in pregnant women with unexplained vaginal wetness.Based on cost modelling, using the Vision ALD is estimated to be cost saving in scenarios considered to be clinically likely, by avoiding the need for referral to an antenatal day unit. When issued by a midwife or other healthcare worker in a primary care setting, cost savings per woman of up to \u00a324.01 (for prelabour rupture of membranes; PROM) and \u00a318.25 (for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes; PPROM) could be achieved. When issued by a community midwife in a woman s home, Vision ALD is associated with an estimated cost saving of up to \u00a321.01 per woman for PROM and \u00a315.25 per woman for PPROM.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

When arranging transfer from one location to another, ensure the following: Before transfer, the woman is dressed, wrapped in a blanket or otherwise covered in a way that she feels is comfortable and appropriate. The woman is made to feel as comfortable as possible before and during transfer. Any ambulance staff or other personnel involved are aware that some positions may make the woman uncomfortable or afraid and could affect her labour, so she should be encouraged to choose how to move and what position to adopt if possible, in accordance with ambulance service protocols.
