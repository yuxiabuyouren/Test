Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH an urgent referral to a specialist with expertise in cardiology for evaluation if they have symptoms or signs of possible coronary heart disease which are not immediately life-threatening. A low threshold for referral is recommended. A person with FH with symptoms or signs of possible coronary heart disease which are immediately life-threatening (for example, acute coronary syndrome \u2013 see NICE s recommendations on initial assessment of chest pain) should be referred to hospital as an emergency in line with advice for the general population. Healthcare professionals should consider offering people with FH a referral for evaluation of coronary heart disease if they have a family history of coronary heart disease in early adulthood, or two or more other cardiovascular risk factors (for example, they are male, they smoke, or they have hypertension or diabetes). Upon diagnosis, healthcare professionals should offer all adults and children/young people with homozygous FH a referral for an evaluation of coronary heart disease. In asymptomatic children and young people under 16 with heterozygous FH, evaluation of coronary heart disease is unlikely to detect clinically significant disease and referral should not be routinely offered.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Throughout the course of an inpatient admission, the personal knowledge and needs of adults with type 1 diabetes regarding their dietary requirements should be a major determinant of the food choices offered to them, except when illness or medical or surgical intervention significantly disturbs those requirements. Members of care teams caring for adults with type 1 diabetes in institutions, such as nursing homes, residential homes and prisons, should follow these recommendations. Provide optimal insulin therapy, which can be achieved by the use of intravenous insulin and glucose, to all adults with type 1 diabetes with threatened or actual stroke.

For the purpose of this guidance, disabling hypoglycaemia is defined as the repeated and unpredictable occurrence of hypoglycaemia that results in persistent anxiety about recurrence and is associated with a significant adverse effect on quality of life or HbA1c levels have remained high (that is, at 8.5% [69 mmol/mol] or above) on MDI therapy (including, if appropriate, the use of long-acting insulin analogues) despite a high level of care.It is recommended that CSII therapy be initiated only by a trained specialist team, which should normally comprise a physician with a specialist interest in insulin pump therapy, a diabetes specialist nurse and a dietitian. Specialist teams should provide structured education programmes and advice on diet, lifestyle and exercise appropriate for people using CSII.Following initiation in adults and children 12 years and older, CSII therapy should only be continued if it results in a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, evidenced by a fall in HbA1c levels, or a sustained decrease in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes. Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set by the responsible physician, in discussion with the person receiving the treatment or their carer.NICE has written information for the public on insulin pump therapy.subhead:Rapid-acting insulinOffer rapid-acting insulin analogues injected before meals, rather than rapid-acting soluble human or animal insulins, for mealtime insulin replacement for adults with type 1 diabetes.Do not advise routine use of rapid-acting insulin analogues after meals for adults with type 1 diabetes.

Interpretation of cardiovascular disease risk scores should always reflect informed clinical judgement.Complete as many fields of the risk assessment tool as possible.When using the risk score to inform drug treatment decisions, particularly if it is near to the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that: may predispose the person to premature cardiovascular disease and may not be included in calculated risk scores.Recognise that standard cardiovascular disease risk scores will underestimate risk in people who have additional risk because of underlying medical conditions or treatments. These groups include:  people treated for HIV people with serious mental health problems  people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotic medication, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs people with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and other systemic inflammatory disorders.Recognise that cardiovascular disease risk will be underestimated in people who are already taking antihypertensive or lipid modification therapy, or who have recently stopped smoking. Use clinical judgement to decide on further treatment of risk factors in people who are below the cardiovascular disease risk threshold for treatment.Severe obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) increases cardiovascular disease risk. Take this into account when using risk scores to inform treatment decisions in this group (see what NICE says on obesity).Consider people aged 85 or older to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of age alone, particularly people who smoke or have raised blood pressure. subhead:Using a risk assessment toolUse the QRISK2 risk assessment tool to assess cardiovascular disease risk for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people up to and including age 84 years.Use the QRISK2 risk assessment tool to assess cardiovascular disease risk in people with type 2 diabetes.subhead:When not to use a risk assessment toolDo not use a risk assessment tool to assess cardiovascular disease risk in people with type 1 diabetes.

For more information, see NICE s recommendations on lipid modification therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease.Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH a referral to a specialist with expertise in FH if they are experiencing side effects that compromise concordance with lipid-modifying drug therapy.For recommendations on managing primary heterozygous FH in people whose LDL-C levels are not adequately controlled despite maximal tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, see the NICE technology appraisal guidance on alirocumab and evolocumab (see below). subhead:StatinsOffer a high-intensity statin with the lowest acquisition cost as the initial treatment for all adults with FH and aim for at least a 50% reduction in LDL-C concentration from the baseline measurement.The dose of statin should be increased to the maximum licensed or tolerated dose to achieve a recommended reduction in LDL-C concentration of greater than 50% from baseline (that is, LDL-C concentration before treatment). Healthcare professionals should offer adults with FH a referral to a specialist with expertise in FH if treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of a high-intensity statin and ezetimibe does not achieve a recommended reduction in LDL-C concentration of greater than 50% from baseline (that is, LDL-C concentration before treatment). When the decision has been made to offer adults with FH treatment with a statin, baseline liver and muscle enzymes (including transaminases and creatine kinase, respectively) should be measured before initiation of therapy. However, people with raised liver or muscle enzymes should not routinely be excluded from statin therapy. Routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with FH who are receiving treatment with a statin. subhead:EzetimibeThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on ezetimibe for the treatment of primary (heterozygous-familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia.Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary (heterozygous-familial or non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia in adults in whom initial statin therapy is contraindicated.Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary (heterozygous-familial or non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia in adults who cannot tolerate statin therapy (as defined below).Ezetimibe, co-administered with initial statin therapy, is recommended as an option for treating primary (heterozygous-familial or non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia in adults who have started statin therapy when: serum total or LDL cholesterol concentration is not appropriately controlled (as defined below) either after appropriate dose titration of initial statin therapy or because dose titration is limited by intolerance to the initial statin therapy (as defined below) and a change from initial statin therapy to an alternative statin is being considered.When prescribing ezetimibe co-administered with a statin, ezetimibe should be prescribed on the basis of lowest acquisition cost.For the purposes of this guidance, intolerance to initial statin therapy is defined as the presence of clinically significant adverse effects that represent an unacceptable risk to the patient or that may reduce compliance with therapy.For the purposes of this guidance, appropriate control of cholesterol concentrations should be based on individual risk assessment according to national guidance on managing cardiovascular disease in the relevant populations.NICE has written information for the public on ezetimibe.subhead:Other lipid-modifying drugsAdults with FH with intolerance or contraindications to statins or ezetimibe should be offered a referral to a specialist with expertise in FH for consideration for treatment with either a bile acid sequestrant (resin) or a fibrate to reduce their LDL-C concentration. The decision to offer treatment with a bile acid sequestrant (resin), nicotinic acid or a fibrate in addition to initial statin therapy should be taken by a specialist with expertise in FH. Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when adding a fibrate or nicotinic acid to a statin because of the risk of muscle-related side effects (including rhabdomyolysis). Gemfibrozil and statins should not be used together. Healthcare professionals should consider offering fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A, D and K) and folic acid supplementation for adults with FH who are receiving long-term treatment with bile acid sequestrants (resins).subhead:Evolocumab The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on evolocumab for treating primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia.Evolocumab is recommended as an option for treating primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, only if: The dosage is 140 mg every 2 weeks. Low-density lipoprotein concentrations are persistently above the thresholds specified in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations above which evolocumab is recommended despite maximal tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. That is, either the maximum dose has been reached, or further titration is limited by (the presence of clinically significant adverse effects that represent an unacceptable risk to the patient or that may reduce compliance with therapy).

A lot of the evidence linking specific circulating glucose concentrations with particular outcomes uses  plasma  rather than  blood  glucose. In addition, patient-held glucose meters and monitoring systems are all calibrated to plasma glucose equivalents. However, the term  blood glucose monitoring  is in very common use, so in these recommendations we use the term  blood glucose , except when referring to specific concentration values.subhead:Blood glucose targetsAdvise adults with type 1 diabetes to aim for:  a fasting plasma glucose level of 5\u20137 mmol/litre on waking and a plasma glucose level of 4\u20137 mmol/litre before meals at other times of the day. Advise adults with type 1 diabetes who choose to test after meals to aim for a plasma glucose level of 5\u20139 mmol/litre at least 90 minutes after eating. (This timing may be different in pregnancy \u2013 for guidance on plasma glucose targets in pregnancy, see NICE s recommendations on diabetes in pregnancy.) Agree bedtime target plasma glucose levels with each adult with type 1 diabetes that take into account timing of the last meal and its related insulin dose, and are consistent with the recommended fasting level on waking. subhead:Self-monitoringAdvise routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for all adults with type 1 diabetes, and recommend testing at least 4 times a day, including before each meal and before bed. Support adults with type 1 diabetes to test at least 4 times a day, and up to 10 times a day if any of the following apply: the desired target for blood glucose control, measured by HbA1c level (see HbA1c measurement and targets), is not achieved the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes increases there is a legal requirement to do so (such as before driving, in line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency [DVLA] At a glance guide to the current medical standards of fitness to drive) during periods of illness  before, during and after sport when planning pregnancy, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding (see NICE s recommendations on diabetes in pregnancy) if there is a need to know blood glucose levels more than 4 times a day for other reasons (for example, impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, high-risk activities). Enable  additional blood glucose testing (more than 10 times a day) for adults with type 1 diabetes if this is necessary because of the person s lifestyle (for example, driving for a long period of time, undertaking high-risk activity or occupation, travel) or if the person has impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. When choosing blood glucose meters: take the needs of the adult with type 1 diabetes into account  ensure that meters meet current ISO standards. Monitoring blood glucose using sites other than the fingertips cannot be recommended as a routine alternative to conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose. For information about self-monitoring skills, see education and information.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on FreeStyle Libre for glucose monitoring.subhead:Continuous glucose monitoringDo not offer real-time continuous glucose monitoring routinely to adults with type 1 diabetes. Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 diabetes who are willing to commit to using it at least 70% of the time and to calibrate it as needed, and who have any of the following despite optimised use of insulin therapy and conventional blood glucose monitoring: More than 1 episode a year of severe hypoglycaemia with no obviously preventable precipitating cause. Complete loss of awareness of hypoglycaemia. Frequent (more than 2 episodes a week) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that is causing problems with daily activities. Extreme fear of hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemia (HbA1c level of 75 mmol/mol [9%] or higher) that persists despite testing at least 10 times a day. Continue real-time continuous glucose monitoring only if HbA1c can be sustained at or below 53 mmol/mol (7%) and/or there has been a fall in HbA1c of 27 mmol/mol (2.5%) or more. For adults with type 1 diabetes who are having real-time continuous glucose monitoring, use the principles of flexible insulin therapy with either a multiple daily injection insulin regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy.Real-time continuous glucose monitoring should be provided by a centre with expertise in its use, as part of strategies to optimise a person s HbA1c levels and reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. Integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systemsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systems for managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes (the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system and the Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system).The MiniMed Paradigm Veo system is recommended as an option for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes only if: they have episodes of disabling hypoglycaemia despite optimal management with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and the company arranges to collect, analyse and publish data on the use of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system (see section 7.1 of NICE diagnostics guidance 21).The MiniMed Paradigm Veo system should be used under the supervision of a trained multidisciplinary team who are experienced in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring for managing type 1 diabetes only if the person or their carer: agrees to use the sensors for at least 70% of the time understands how to use it and is physically able to use the system and agrees to use the system while having a structured education programme on diet and lifestyle, and counselling.People who start to use the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system should only continue to use it if they have a decrease in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes that is sustained. Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set.The Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system shows promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to support its routine adoption in the NHS for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes. Robust evidence is needed to show the clinical effectiveness of using the technology in practice.People with type 1 diabetes who are currently provided with the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system or the Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system by the NHS for clinical indications that are not recommended in this NICE guidance should be able to continue using them until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Diabetes in pregnancy6Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels during pregnancySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Use the Gold score or Clarke score to quantify awareness of hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes, checking that the questionnaire items have been answered correctly. Explain to adults with type 1 diabetes that impaired awareness of the symptoms of plasma glucose levels below 3 mmol/litre is associated with a significantly increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia. subhead:Strategies for managing impaired awareness of hypoglycaemiaEnsure that adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia have had structured education in flexible insulin therapy using basal\u2013bolus regimens and are following its principles correctly.Offer additional education focusing on avoiding and treating hypoglycaemia to adults with type 1 diabetes who continue to have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia after structured education in flexible insulin therapy.Avoid relaxing individualised blood glucose targets as a treatment for adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia.If target blood glucose levels preferred by adults with type 1 diabetes who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia are lower than recommended, reinforce the recommended targets (see blood glucose measurement and targets). Review insulin regimens and doses and prioritise strategies to avoid hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, including: reinforcing the principles of structured education offering continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy offering real-time continuous glucose monitoring. If impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia is associated with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in an adult with type 1 diabetes despite these interventions, consider referring the person to a specialist centre. subhead:Preventing and managing hypoglycaemiaExplain to adults with type 1 diabetes that a fast-acting form of glucose is needed for the management of hypoglycaemic symptoms or signs in people who are able to swallow. Adults with type 1 diabetes with a decreased level of consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia and so are unable to take oral treatment safely should be: given intramuscular glucagon by a family member or friend who has been shown how to use it (intravenous glucose may be used by healthcare professionals skilled in obtaining intravenous access) monitored for response at 10 minutes, and then given intravenous glucose if their level of consciousness is not improving significantly then given oral carbohydrate when it is safe to administer it, and placed under continued observation by a third party who has been warned of the risk of relapse. Explain to adults with type 1 diabetes that some hypoglycaemic episodes are an inevitable consequence of insulin therapy in most people using any insulin regimen, and that it is advisable that they should use a regimen that avoids or reduces the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes while maintaining as optimal a level of blood glucose control as is feasible. Make advice available to all adults with type 1 diabetes to assist in obtaining the best such balance from any insulin regimen. (See insulin therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes.) If hypoglycaemia becomes unusually problematic or of increased frequency, review the following possible contributory causes: inappropriate insulin regimens (incorrect dose distributions and insulin types) meal and activity patterns, including alcohol injection technique and skills, including insulin resuspension if necessary injection site problems possible organic causes including gastroparesis changes in insulin sensitivity (including drugs affecting the renin\u2013angiotensin system and renal failure) psychological problems previous physical activity lack of appropriate knowledge and skills for self-management. Manage nocturnal hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or detected on monitoring) by: reviewing knowledge and self-management skills reviewing current insulin regimen, evening eating habits and previous physical activity choosing an insulin type and regimen that is less likely to induce low glucose levels at night. If early cognitive decline occurs in adults on long-term insulin therapy, supplement normal investigations by the consideration or investigation of possible brain damage resulting from overt or covert hypoglycaemia, and the need to ameliorate this.

Diabetes professionals should: ensure that they have appropriate skills in the detection and basic management of non-severe psychological disorders in people from different cultural backgrounds be familiar with appropriate counselling techniques and drug therapy, while arranging prompt referral to specialists of those people in whom psychological difficulties continue to interfere significantly with wellbeing or diabetes self-management.

See also NICE s recommendations on eating disorders. The risk of morbidity from the complications of poor metabolic control suggests that consideration should be given to early, and occasionally urgent, referral of adults with type 1 diabetes to local eating disorder services.

Consider capillary blood ketone testing for inpatient management of DKA in adults with type 1 diabetes that is incorporated into a formal protocol. subhead:Management of DKAProfessionals managing DKA in adults should be adequately trained, including regular updating, and be familiar with all aspects of its management which are associated with mortality and morbidity. These topics should include: fluid balance acidosis cerebral oedema electrolyte imbalance disturbed interpretation of familiar diagnostic tests (white cell count, body temperature, ECG) respiratory distress syndrome cardiac abnormalities precipitating causes infection management, including opportunistic infections gastroparesis use of high dependency and intensive care units recommendations below.Management of DKA in adults should be in line with local clinical governance. For primary fluid replacement in adults with DKA, use isotonic saline, not given too rapidly except in cases of circulatory collapse. Do not generally use bicarbonate in the management of DKA in adults. Give intravenous insulin by infusion to adults with DKA. In the management of DKA in adults, once the plasma glucose concentration has fallen to 10\u201315 mmol/litre, give glucose-containing fluids (not more than 2 litres in 24 hours) in order to allow continued infusion of insulin at a sufficient rate to clear ketones (for example, 6 units/hour monitored for effect).Begin potassium replacement early in DKA in adults, with frequent monitoring for the development of hypokalaemia.Do not generally use phosphate replacement in the management of DKA in adults. In adults with DKA whose conscious level is impaired, consideration should be given to inserting a nasogastric tube, monitoring urine production using a urinary catheter and giving heparin. To reduce the risk of catastrophic outcomes in adults with DKA, ensure that monitoring is continuous and that review covers all aspects of clinical management at frequent intervals.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
