If the axial length is between 22.00 and 26.00 mm, use Barrett Universal II if it is installed on the biometry device and does not need the results to be transcribed by hand. Use SRK/T if not. If the axial length is more than 26.00 mm, use Haigis or SRK/T.Advise people who have had previous corneal refractive surgery that refractive outcomes after cataract surgery are difficult to predict, and that they may need further surgery if they do not want to wear spectacles for distance vision.If people have had previous corneal refractive surgery, adjust for the altered relationship between the anterior and posterior corneal curvature. Do not use standard biometry techniques or historical data alone.Surgeons should think about modifying a manufacturer s recommended intraocular lens constant, guided by learning gained from their previous deviations from predicted refractive outcomes.subhead:Second-eye predictionConsider using 50% of the first-eye prediction error in observed refractive outcome to guide calculations for the intraocular lens power for second-eye cataract surgery.subhead:Risk stratificationConsider using a validated risk stratification algorithm for people who have been referred for cataract surgery, to identify people at increased risk of complications during and after surgery.Explain the results of the risk stratification to the person, and discuss how it may affect their decisions.To minimise the risk of complications during and after surgery, ensure that surgeons in training are closely supervised when they perform cataract surgery in:  people who are at high risk of complications or  people for whom the impact of complications would be especially severe (for example, people with only 1 functional eye).Explain to people who are at risk of developing a dense cataract that there is an increased risk of complications if surgery is delayed and the cataract becomes more dense.subhead:Patient informationAt the preoperative outpatient appointment, review and expand on the topics in patient information in referral for cataract surgery, and give people information about: the refractive implications of different intraocular lenses (see above) types of anaesthesia  the person s individual risk of complications during or after surgery (for example, the risk of postoperative retinal detachment in people with high myopia; also see risk stratification above) what to do and what to expect on the day of cataract surgery what to do and what to expect after cataract surgery what support might be needed after surgery medicines after surgery (for example, eye drops) and medicines that people may be already taking (for example, anticoagulants) the refractive implications after previous corneal refractive surgery, if appropriate (see biometry formulas above) bilateral simultaneous cataract surgery, if appropriate (also see bilateral surgery in surgical timing and technique).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
