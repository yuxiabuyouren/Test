Withdrawal should be planned and stepwise with a daily review of the patient s progress.Nutrition support should be cautiously introduced in seriously ill or injured people requiring parenteral nutrition. It should be started at no more than 50% of the estimated target energy and protein needs. It should be built up to meet full needs over the first 24-48 hours according to metabolic and gastrointestinal tolerance. Full requirements of fluid, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals should be provided from the outset of feeding.People who have eaten little or nothing for more than 5 days should have nutrition support introduced at no more than 50% of requirements for the first 2 days, before increasing feed rates to meet full needs if clinical and biochemical monitoring reveals no refeeding problems.The prescription should be reviewed according to the person s progress, and care should be taken when: using food fortification which tends to supplement energy and/or protein without adequate micronutrients and minerals using feeds and supplements that meet full energy and nitrogen needs, as they may not provide adequate micronutrients and minerals when only used in a supplementary role using pre-mixed parenteral nutrition bags that have not had tailored additions from pharmacy.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Decisions on withholding or withdrawing of nutrition support require a consideration of both ethical and legal principles (both at common law and statute including the Human Rights Act 1998).When such decisions are being made, the General Medical Council s treatment and care towards the end of life: decision making and the Department of Health s reference guide to consent for examination or treatment, second edition 2009 should be followed.Healthcare professionals should ensure that people having nutrition support, and their carers, are kept fully informed about their treatment. They should also have access to appropriate information and be given the opportunity to discuss diagnosis and treatment options.See what NICE says on end of life care for people with life-limiting conditions.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2TreatmentSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

People being discharged before 2 weeks can be started on long-term treatment earlier. Any person with acute ischaemic stroke for whom previous dyspepsia associated with aspirin is reported should be given a proton pump inhibitor in addition to aspirin. (Aspirin intolerance is defined in NICE technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole in the prevention of occlusive vascular events as either of the following: proven hypersensitivity to aspirin-containing medicines; or history of severe dyspepsia induced by low-dose aspirin.)Any person with acute ischaemic stroke who is allergic to or genuinely intolerant of aspirin should be given an alternative antiplatelet agent. Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamoleThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular events.Clopidogrel is recommended as an option to prevent occlusive vascular events for people who have had an ischaemic stroke or who have peripheral arterial disease or multivascular disease.Modified-release dipyridamole in combination with aspirin is recommended as an option to prevent occlusive vascular events for people who have had an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated.Modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended as an option to prevent occlusive vascular events for people who have had an ischaemic stroke only if aspirin and clopidogrel are contraindicated or not tolerated.Treatment with clopidogrel to prevent occlusive vascular events should be started with the least costly licensed preparation.People currently receiving clopidogrel or modified-release dipyridamole either with or without aspirin outside these criteria (listed above) should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole.subhead:Anticoagulation treatmentAnticoagulation treatment should not be used routinely for the treatment of acute stroke. (There may be a subgroup of people for whom the risk of venous thromboembolism outweighs the risk of haemorrhagic transformation. People considered to be at particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism include anyone with complete paralysis of the leg, a previous history of venous thromboembolism, dehydration or comorbidities [such as malignant disease], or who is a current or recent smoker. Such people should be kept under regular review if they are given prophylactic anticoagulation. For further information about preventing venous thromboembolism, see what NICE says on venous thromboembolism.)subhead:Acute venous strokePeople diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (including those with secondary cerebral haemorrhage) should be given full-dose anticoagulation treatment (initially full-dose heparin and then warfarin [INR 2\u20133]) unless there are comorbidities that preclude its use.subhead:Stroke associated with arterial dissectionPeople with stroke secondary to acute arterial dissection should be treated with either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, preferably as part of a randomised controlled trial to compare the effects of the two treatments.subhead:Acute ischaemic stroke associated with antiphospholipid syndromePeople with antiphospholipid syndrome who have an acute ischaemic stroke should be managed in same way as people with acute ischaemic stroke without antiphospholipid syndrome.subhead:Disabling ischaemic stroke with atrial fibrillationPeople with disabling ischaemic stroke who are in atrial fibrillation should be treated with aspirin 300 mg for the first 2 weeks before considering anticoagulation treatment. See also what NICE says on atrial fibrillation.subhead:Other comorbiditiesIn people with prosthetic valves who have disabling cerebral infarction and who are at significant risk of haemorrhagic transformation, anticoagulation treatment should be stopped for 1 week and aspirin 300 mg substituted. People with ischaemic stroke and symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism should receive anticoagulation treatment in preference to treatment with aspirin unless there are other contraindications to anticoagulation.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), for example, may be used to do this.When screening for malnutrition and the risk of malnutrition, healthcare professionals should be aware that dysphagia, poor oral health and reduced ability to self-feed will affect nutrition in people with stroke.Screening for malnutrition and the risk of malnutrition should be carried out by healthcare professionals with appropriate skills and training.Routine nutritional supplementation is not recommended for people with acute stroke who are adequately nourished on admission.Nutrition support should be initiated for people with stroke who are at risk of malnutrition.
