Follow the principles in the recommendations in enabling patients to actively participate in their care, in patient experience.Provide information to the child or young person, and their parents or carers, on an ongoing basis.  Adapt the communication methods and information resources to take account of the needs and understanding of the child or young person and their parents or carers. For example, think about using 1 or more of the following: oral explanations written information and leaflets mobile technology, including apps augmentative and alternative communication systems (see speech, language and communication).Work with the child or young person and their parents and carers to develop and maintain a personal  folder  in their preferred format (electronic or otherwise) containing relevant information that can be shared with their extended family and friends and used in health, social care, educational and transition settings. Information could include: early history motor subtype and limb involvement functional abilities interventions medication comorbidities preferred methods of communication any specialist equipment that is used or needed care plans emergency contact details.Ensure that the child or young person and their parents or carers are provided with information, by a professional with appropriate expertise, about the following topics relevant to them that is tailored to their individual needs: menstruation fertility contraception sex and sexuality parenting.Provide information to the child or young person and their parents and carers, and to all relevant teams around them, about the local and regional services available (for example, sporting clubs, respite care and specialist schools) for children and young people with cerebral palsy, and how to access them.Provide information about local support and advocacy groups to the child or young person and their parents or carers.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on cerebral palsy.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.3Information for parents and carers of children and young people with cerebral palsy4Personal folders for children and young people with cerebral palsySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If a child can sit at 2 years of age it is likely, but not certain, that they will be able to walk unaided by age 6. If a child cannot sit but can roll at 2 years of age, there is a possibility that they may be able to walk unaided by age 6. If a child cannot sit or roll at 2 years of age, they are unlikely to be able to walk unaided.Recognise the following in relation to prognosis for speech development in a child with cerebral palsy, and discuss this with parents and carers as appropriate: Around 1 in 2 children with cerebral palsy have some difficulty with elements of communication (see speech language and communication).  Around 1 in 3 children have difficulties with speech and language. The more severe the child s physical, functional or cognitive impairment, the greater the likelihood of difficulties with speech and language. Uncontrolled epilepsy may be associated with difficulties with all forms of communication, including speech. A child with bilateral spastic, dyskinetic or ataxic cerebral palsy is more likely to have difficulties with speech than a child with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.subhead:Life expectancyProvide the following information to parents and carers, as appropriate, about prognosis for life expectancy for a child with cerebral palsy: The more severe the child s physical, functional or cognitive impairment, the greater the likelihood of reduced life expectancy. There is an association between reduced life expectancy and the need for enteral tube feeding, but this reflects the severity of swallowing difficulties and is not because of the intervention.subhead:Use of MRI to determine prognosisDo not rely on MRI alone for predicting prognosis in children with cerebral palsy.Take account of the likely cause of cerebral palsy and the findings from MRI (if performed) when discussing prognosis with the child or young person and their parents or carers.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
