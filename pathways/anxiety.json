Relatively few mental health professionals or GPs have expertise in the recognition, assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the less common forms of OCD and BDD.Each PCT, mental healthcare trust and children s trust that provides mental health services should have access to a specialist OCD/BDD multidisciplinary team offering age-appropriate care. This team would perform the following functions: increase the skills of mental health professionals in the assessment and evidence-based treatment of people with OCD or BDD, provide high-quality advice, understand family and developmental needs, and, when appropriate, conduct expert assessment and specialist cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological treatment.Specialist mental healthcare professionals in OCD or BDD should collaborate with local and national voluntary organisations to increase awareness and understanding of the disorders and improve access to high\u2011quality information about them. Such information should also be made available to primary and secondary healthcare professionals, and to professionals from other public services who may come into contact with people of any age with OCD or BDD.

Do you check things a lot? Is there any thought that keeps bothering you that you would like to get rid of but can not? Do your daily activities take a long time to finish? Are you concerned about putting things in a special order or are you very upset by mess? Do these problems trouble you?In people who have been diagnosed with OCD, healthcare professionals should assess the risk of self-harm and suicide, especially if they have also been diagnosed with depression. Part of the risk assessment should include the impact of their compulsive behaviours on themselves or others. Other comorbid conditions and psychosocial factors that may contribute to risk should also be considered.If healthcare professionals are uncertain about the risks associated with intrusive sexual, aggressive or death-related thoughts reported by people with OCD, they should consult mental health professionals with specific expertise in the assessment and management of OCD. These themes are common in people with OCD at any age, and are often misinterpreted as indicating risk.subhead:Body dysmorphic disorderFor people known to be at higher risk of BDD (such as individuals with symptoms of depression, social phobia, alcohol or substance misuse, OCD or an eating disorder), or for people with mild disfigurements or blemishes who are seeking a cosmetic or dermatological procedure, healthcare professionals should routinely consider and explore the possibility of BDD.For further information, see what NICE says on depression, social anxiety disorder, alcohol-use disorders and eating disorders. In the assessment of people at higher risk of BDD, the following five questions should be asked to help identify individuals with BDD: Do you worry a lot about the way you look and wish you could think about it less? What specific concerns do you have about your appearance? On a typical day, how many hours a day is your appearance on your mind? (More than 1 hour a day is considered excessive.) What effect does it have on your life? Does it make it hard to do your work or be with your friends?People with suspected or diagnosed BDD seeking cosmetic surgery or dermatological treatment should be assessed by a mental health professional with specific expertise in the management of BDD.In people who have been diagnosed with BDD, healthcare professionals should assess the risk of self-harm and suicide, especially if they have also been diagnosed with depression. Other comorbid conditions and psychosocial factors that may contribute to risk should also be considered.All children and young people who have been diagnosed with BDD should be assessed for suicidal ideation and a full risk assessment should be carried out before treatment is undertaken. If risks are identified, all professionals involved in primary and secondary care should be informed and appropriate risk management strategies put into place.Specialist mental health professionals in BDD should work in partnership with cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists to ensure that an agreed screening system is in place to accurately identify people with BDD and that agreed referral criteria have been established. They should help provide training opportunities for cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists to aid in the recognition of BDD.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

There is insufficient evidence on which to recommend a well-validated, self-reporting screening instrument to use in the diagnostic process, and so consultation skills should be relied upon to elicit all necessary information.subhead:ComorbiditiesThe clinician should be alert to the common clinical situation of comorbidity, in particular, panic disorder with depression and panic disorder with substance misuse. The main problem(s) to be treated should be identified through a process of discussion with the person. In determining the priorities of the comorbidities, the sequencing of the problems should be clarified. This can be helped by drawing up a timeline to identify when the various problems developed. By understanding when the symptoms developed, a better understanding of the relative priorities of the comorbidities can be achieved, and there is a better opportunity of developing an effective intervention that fits the needs of the individual. subhead:Presentation at A&E or other settingIf a person presents in A&E, or other settings, with a panic attack, they should: be asked if they are already receiving treatment for panic disorder undergo the minimum investigations necessary to exclude acute physical problems not usually be admitted to a medical or psychiatric bed be referred to primary care for subsequent care, even if assessment has been undertaken in A&E be given appropriate written information about panic attacks and why they are being referred to primary care be offered appropriate written information about sources of support, including local and national voluntary and self-help groups.

Multidisciplinary teams with a high degree of expertise in the pharmacological and psychological treatment of OCD should have been recently involved in the patient s care. All pharmacological options should have been considered and every attempt should have been made to engage the individual in CBT (including ERP) and cognitive therapy, including very intensive and/or inpatient treatments. Standardised assessment protocols should be used pre- and post-operation and at medium- and long-term follow-ups in order to audit the interventions. These assessment protocols should include standardised measures of symptoms, quality of life, social and personality function, as well as comprehensive neuropsychological tests.  Services offering assessment for neurosurgical treatments should have access to independent advice on issues such as adequacy of previous treatment and consent and should be subject to appropriate oversight. Post-operative care should be carefully considered, including pharmacological and psychological therapies. Services offering assessment for neurosurgical treatments should be committed to sharing and publishing audit information. For children and young people with severe OCD or BDD with high levels of distress and/or functional impairment, if there has been no response to adequate treatment in outpatient settings, or there is significant self-neglect or risk of suicide, assessment for intensive inpatient treatment in units where specialist treatment for children or young people with OCD or BDD is available should be offered.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The timing of transition may vary locally and individually but should usually be completed by the time the young person is 18 years. Variations should be agreed by both child and adult services.As part of the preparation for the transition to adult services, health and social care professionals should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the young person with autism. The assessment should make best use of existing documentation about personal, educational, occupational, social and communication functioning, and should include assessment of any coexisting conditions, especially depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD and global delay or intellectual disability in line with comprehensive assessment.For young people aged 16 or older whose needs are complex or severe, use the CPA in England, or care and treatment plans in Wales, as an aid to transfer between services. Involve the young person in the planning and, where appropriate, their parents or carers.

Consider paroxetine or mirtazapine (for general use) and amitriptyline or phenelzine (under specialist mental health care supervision) in adults with PTSDParoxetine is the only drug listed with a current UK product licence for PTSD at the date of publication of this pathway (March 2012). : if the person prefers not to engage in a trauma-focused psychological treatment if the person cannot start psychological treatment because of serious threat of further trauma  if the person has gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment as an adjunct to psychological treatment where there is significant comorbid depression or severe hyperarousal that significantly affects the person s ability to benefit from psychological treatment. For sleep disturbance, consider: hypnotic medication for short-term use a suitable antidepressant for longer-term use, introduced at an early stage to reduce later risk of dependence.When an adult with PTSD responds to drug treatment, continue the treatment for at least 12 months before gradual withdrawal.When an adult with PTSD does not respond to drug treatment, consider increasing the dose within approved limits. If further drug treatment is considered, it should generally be with a different class of antidepressant or involve the use of adjunctive olanzapine. subhead:Starting drug treatmentsInform all adults with PTSD who are prescribed antidepressants of potential side effects and discontinuation or withdrawal symptoms (particularly with paroxetine) at the time that treatment is initiated.See adults with PTSD who are at increased risk of suicide, and all people with PTSD aged 18\u201329, after 1 week of starting antidepressants and frequently thereafter until the risk is not considered significant.Seek out signs of akathisia, suicidal ideation and increased anxiety and agitation, particularly in the initial stages of SSRI treatment. Advise adults with PTSD of the risk of these symptoms and to seek help promptly if these are distressing.Review the use of the drug if the person with PTSD develops marked and/or prolonged akathisia.See adults with PTSD who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide after 2 weeks of starting antidepressants and thereafter on an appropriate and regular basis (for example every 2\u20134 weeks in the first 3 months, and at greater intervals thereafter if response is good).For information on using drug treatments in pregnancy and the postnatal period see pharmacological treatments for antenatal and postnatal mental health problems in the NICE pathway on antenatal and postnatal mental health.subhead:Discontinuation/withdrawal symptomsGradually reduce the dose of antidepressants over a 4-week period (some people may require longer periods). If discontinuation/withdrawal symptoms are mild, reassure the person with PTSD and arrange for monitoring. If symptoms are severe, consider re-introducing the original antidepressant (or another with a longer half-life from the same class) and reduce gradually while monitoring symptoms.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
