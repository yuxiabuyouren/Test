Responders should be assessed at intervals of approximately 12 weeks thereafter. Continuation of treatment is recommended at 400 mg/day until the tumour ceases to respond. An increase in the dose of imatinib is not recommended for people receiving imatinib who develop progressive disease after initially responding.The use of imatinib should be supervised by cancer specialists with experience in the management of people with unresectable and/or metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumours.NICE has written information for the public on imatinib for unresectable and/or metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumours.subhead:High-dose imatinib The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on imatinib for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours.Imatinib at 600 or 800 mg/day is not recommended for people with unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours whose disease has progressed after treatment with 400 mg/day imatinib.People who are currently receiving 600 or 800 mg/day imatinib for unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours should have the option to continue therapy until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop. NICE has written information for the public on high-dose imatinib.subhead:Sunitinib The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on  sunitinib for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.Sunitinib is recommended, within its licensed indication, as a treatment option for people with unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours if: imatinib treatment has failed because of resistance or intolerance, and the drug cost of sunitinib (excluding any related costs) for the first treatment cycle will be met by the manufacturer.The use of sunitinib should be supervised by cancer specialists with experience in treating people with unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours after failure of imatinib treatment because of resistance or intolerance. NICE has written information for the public on sunitinib.subhead:Regorafenib The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on  regorafenib for previously treated unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours.Regorafenib is recommended as an option for treating unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours in adults whose disease has progressed on, or who are intolerant to, prior treatment with imatinib and sunitinib, only if: their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG ) performance status is 0 to 1 and the company provides regorafenib with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.When using ECOG performance status, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect ECOG performance status and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.These recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with regorafenib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside these recommendations may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.See why we made the recommendations on regorafenib.NICE has written information for the public on regorafenib.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Reassure people in the safety netting group (see referral and safety netting) who are concerned that they may have cancer that with their current symptoms their risk of having cancer is low.  Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see referral and safety netting) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist.

This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical.  Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be: planned within a time frame agreed with the person or patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
