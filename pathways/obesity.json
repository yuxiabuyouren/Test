Recognise that surprise, anger, denial or disbelief about their health situation may diminish people s ability or willingness to change. Stress that obesity is a clinical term with specific health implications, rather than a question of how people look; this may reduce any negative feelings. During the consultation: Assess the person s view of their weight and the diagnosis, and possible reasons for weight gain. Explore eating patterns and physical activity levels. Explore any beliefs about eating and physical activity and weight gain that are unhelpful if the person wants to lose weight. Be aware that people from certain ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds may be at greater risk of obesity, and may have different beliefs about what is a healthy weight and different attitudes towards weight management. Find out what the person has already tried and how successful this has been, and what they learned from the experience. Assess the person s readiness to adopt changes. Assess the person s confidence in making changes. Give people and their families and/or carers information on the reasons for tests, how the tests are done and their results and meaning. If necessary, offer another consultation to fully explore the options for treatment or discuss test results.Take measurements (see identifying and assessing people who are overweight or obese in this pathway) to determine degree of overweight or obesity and discuss the implications of the person s weight.

For example: Work with food manufacturers to improve the composition of prepared foods, where needed, to decrease calories, saturated fat and salt content. Encourage manufacturers to achieve any nationally agreed reformulation targets. Work with caterers across the industry to help them reduce the amount of calories, saturated fat and salt in recipes and to use healthier cooking methods. They should also ensure healthier options are an integral part of all menus. Work with food retailers to develop pricing structures that favour healthier food and drink choices. Work with food retailers to ensure a range of portion sizes are available and that they are priced accordingly. This is particularly important for energy-dense foods and drinks. Work with food manufacturers, caterers and retailers to provide clear, non-ambiguous and consistent nutrition information. This includes prominent displays of calorie content on the front of packaging and the use of clear signage for unpackaged food and drink. If calorie content is not known, consider indicating healthier options, such as food prepared using healthier ingredients or cooking methods. Support the development of home-cooking resources that give information on nutritional content (for example, web-based recipe sites). Offer practical advice on preparing healthier meals, including the ingredients and cooking methods to use.Monitor the population s diet to determine the success of national-level interventions.

Current advertising restrictions have reduced the number of advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar during television programmes made for children and young people. However, advertisements, promotions, product placements and sponsorship shown between programmes for older audiences also have a powerful influence on children and young people. Marketing bans have been successfully introduced in several other countries; evidence shows that a 9pm watershed for such TV advertisements would reduce children and young people s exposure to this type of advertising by 82%Office of Communications (2006) Annex 7 \u2013 impact assessment. Annex to consultation on television advertising of food and drink to children. .Policy goalEnsure children and young people under 16 are protected from all forms of marketing, advertising and promotions (including product placements) which encourage an unhealthy diet. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsDevelop a comprehensive, agreed set of principles for food and beverage marketing aimed at children and young people. This could be similar to the  Sydney principles Swinburn B, Sacks G, Lobstein T et al. (2007) The  Sydney principles  for reducing the commercial promotion of foods and beverages to children. Public Health Nutrition 11 (9): 881\u20136.. They should be based on a child s right to a healthy diet.Extend TV advertising scheduling restrictions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar (as determined by the nutrient profile developed by the Food Standards Agency) up to 9pm.Develop equivalent standards, supported by legislation, to restrict the marketing, advertising and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar via all non-broadcast media. This includes manufacturers  websites, use of the Internet generally, mobile phones and other new technologies.Ensure restrictions for non-broadcast media on advertising, marketing and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar are underpinned by the nutrient profiling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.subhead:Commercial interests ContextIf deaths and illnesses associated with cardiovascular disease are to be reduced, it is important that food and drink manufacturers, retailers, caterers, producers and growers, along with associated organisations, deliver goods that underpin this goal. Many commercial organisations are already taking positive action.Policy goalEnsure dealings between government, government agencies and the commercial sector are conducted in a transparent manner that supports public health objectives and is in line with best practice. (This includes full disclosure of interests.) To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage best practice for all meetings, including lobbying, between the food and drink industry and government (and government agencies). This includes full disclosure of interests by all parties.

Use information from sources such as the joint strategic needs assessment and local cycling and walking implementation plans. Follow established best practice to ensure everyone s needs are identified and addressed, including those of people with limited mobility. Use community engagement approaches to develop and review these local strategies, policies and plans:  Take account of the views and needs of people who walk, cycle, drive or use public transport in the local area, particularly in relation to shared or contested space. (For example, space shared by pedestrians and cyclists, or cyclists and motorists.)  Take account of the views and needs of people with limited mobility who may be adversely affected by the design and maintenance of streets, footways and footpaths and urban and rural public open spaces. Take account of the views of voluntary and community sector organisations. Assess whether initiatives successfully adopted elsewhere are appropriate locally and, if they are, how they can be adapted to local needs.See why we made the recommendations on encouraging and enabling increased physical activity.For more information see NICE s recommendations on community engagement.subhead:People with limited mobilityDevelop and put policies into place to ensure people with limited mobility can safely move along and across streets and in public open spaces:  Adopt a consistent approach to permanent or temporary obstructions. This may include vegetation, vending boards, bins, parked cars, scaffolding and street furniture.  Ensure that there are enough pedestrian-controlled crossings, and that they all incorporate accessibility features. Also ensure that signal-controlled crossings give enough time to cross the road safely. Provide accessible temporary crossings during street and road works (see the Department for Transport s Safety at street works and road works). Use and maintain tactile paving and dropped kerbs correctly (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces).  Provide step-free access or, where this is not possible, clearly signposted accessible alternatives. See why we made the recommendations on policies for people with limited mobility.subhead:Prioritise physical activity in daily lifeEnsure planning permissions always prioritise the need for people (including people with limited mobility) to be physically active as a routine part of their daily life, for example ensuring access on foot to local services such as shops and public transport stops.For more information see Public Health England s Spatial planning for health report. Ensure children, young people and their families and carers can be physically active, for example when playing and when travelling to school, college and early years settings.Use existing health impact assessment tools to assess in advance what impact (both intended and unintended) any proposed changes are likely to have on physical activity levels. For example, will local services be accessible on foot, by bike, and by people with limited mobility?

High levels of salt in processed food have a major impact on the total amount consumed by the population. Over recent years the food industry, working with the Food Standards Agency, has made considerable progress in reducing salt in everyday foods. As a result, products with no added salt are now increasingly available. However, it is taking too long to reduce average salt intake among the population. Furthermore, average intake among children is above the recommended level \u2013 and some children consume as much salt as adults. Progress towards a low-salt diet needs to be accelerated as a matter of urgency.Policy goalReduce population-level consumption of salt. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAccelerate the reduction in salt intake among the population. Aim for a maximum intake of 6 g per day per adult by 2015 and 3 g by 2025.Ensure children s salt intake does not exceed age-appropriate guidelines (these guidelines should be based on up-to-date assessments of the available scientific evidence). Promote the benefits of a reduction in the population s salt intake to the European Union (EU). Introduce national legislation if necessary.Ensure national policy on salt in England is not weakened by less effective action in other parts of the EU.Ensure food producers and caterers continue to reduce the salt content of commonly consumed foods (including bread, meat products, cheese, soups and breakfast cereals). This can be achieved by progressively changing recipes, products and manufacturing and production methods.Establish the principle that children under 11 should consume substantially less salt than adults. (This is based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.)Support the Department of Health so that it can continue to promote \u2013 and take the lead on \u2013 the development of EU-wide salt targets for processed foods. Establish an independent system for monitoring national salt levels in commonly consumed foods.Ensure low-salt products are sold more cheaply than their higher salt equivalents. Clearly label products which are naturally high in salt and cannot meaningfully be reformulated. Use the traffic light system developed by the Food Standards Agency. The labels should also state that these products should only be consumed occasionally. Discourage the use of potassium and other substitutes to replace salt. The aim of avoiding potassium substitution is twofold: to help consumers  readjust their perception of  saltiness  and to avoid additives which may have other effects on health.Promote best practice in relation to the reduction of salt consumption, as exemplified in these recommendations, to the wider EU.subhead:Saturated fatsContextReducing general consumption of saturated fat is crucial to preventing CVD. Over recent years, much has been done (by the Food Standards Agency, consumers and industry) to reduce the population s intake. Consumption levels are gradually moving towards the goal set by the Food Standards Agency: to reduce population intake of saturated fat from 13.3% to below 11% of food energy. However, a further substantial reduction would greatly reduce CVD and deaths from CVD. Taking the example of Japan (where consumption of saturated fat is much lower than in the UK), halving the average intake (from 14% to 6\u20137% of total energy) might prevent approximately 30,000 CVD deaths annually. It would also prevent a corresponding number of new cases of CVD annually. (Note that low-fat products are not recommended for children under 2 years, but are fine thereafter.)Policy goal Reduce population-level consumption of saturated fat. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage manufacturers, caterers and producers to reduce substantially the amount of saturated fat in all food products. If necessary, consider supportive legislation. Ensure no manufacturer, caterer or producer is at an unfair advantage as a result.Create the conditions whereby products containing lower levels of saturated fat are sold more cheaply than high saturated fat products. Consider legislation and fiscal levers if necessary.Create favourable conditions for industry and agriculture to produce dairy products for human consumption that are low in saturated fat.Continue to promote semi-skimmed milk for children aged over 2 years. This is in line with the American Heart Association s pediatric dietary strategyAmerican Heart Association (2005) Dietary recommendations for children and adolescents. A guide for practitioners: consensus statement from the American Heart Association. Circulation 112: 2061\u201375. Available at http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/13/2061.subhead:Trans fatsContextIPTFAs constitute a significant health hazard. In recent years many manufacturers and caterers, with the encouragement of the Food Standards Agency and other organisations, have considerably reduced the amount of IPTFAs in their products. However, certain sections of the population may be consuming a substantially higher amount of IPTFAs than average (for instance, those who regularly eat fried fast-food). It is important to protect all social groups from the adverse effects of IPTFAs. In some countries and regions (for instance, Denmark, Austria and New York), IPTFAs have been successfully banned. A study for the European Parliament recently recommended that it, too, should consider an EU-wide ban. In the meantime, some large UK caterers, retailers and producers have removed IPTFAs from their products.Policy goalEnsure all groups in the population are protected from the harmful effects of IPTFAs. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEliminate the use of IPTFAs for human consumption.In line with other EU countries (specifically, Denmark and Austria), introduce legislation to ensure that IPTFA levels do not exceed 2% in the fats and oils used in food manufacturing and cooking.Direct the bodies responsible for national surveys to measure and report on consumption of IPTFAs by different population subgroups \u2013 rather than only by mean consumption across the population as a whole.Establish guidelines for local authorities to monitor independently IPTFA levels in the restaurant, fast-food and home food trades using existing statutory powers (in relation to trading standards or environmental health).Create and sustain local and national conditions which support a reduction in the amount of IPTFAs in foods, while ensuring levels of saturated fat are not increased. Encourage the use of vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to replace oils containing IPTFAs. Saturated fats should not be used as an IPTFA substitute.Develop UK-validated guidelines and information for the food service sector and local government on removing IPTFAs from the food preparation process. This will support UK-wide implementation of any legislation produced on IPTFAs. SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.subhead:Responding to children and young peopleIdentify local factors that may affect whether or not children and young people are physically active by regularly consulting with them, their parents and carers.Find out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instruction for activities aimed at children and young peopleEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities.

This includes, for example, introducing physically active travel plans for staff to promote walking and cycling to and from work. It also includes considering the design of working environments to increase opportunities for physical activity. (See the NICE pathways on physical activity and walking and cycling.) Local authorities and NHS organisations should offer lifestyle weight management service(s) (in line with best practice outlined in the NICE pathway on obesity) for overweight or obese staff who would like support to manage their weight.Local authority and NHS commissioners should consider how their decisions impact on obesity in the local community.

All appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried but the person has not achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss.  The person has been receiving or will receive intensive management in a tier 3 service. (For more information on tier 3 services, see NHS England s report on joined up clinical pathways for obesity.) The person is generally fit for anaesthesia and surgery. The person commits to the need for long-term follow-up. In addition to the criteria listed above, bariatric surgery is the option of choice (instead of lifestyle interventions or drug treatment) for adults with a BMI of more than 50 kg/m2 when other interventions have not been effective.The hospital specialist and/or bariatric surgeon should discuss the following with people who are severely obese if they are considering surgery to aid weight reduction: the potential benefits  the longer-term implications of surgery associated risks complications perioperative mortality.The discussion should also include the person s family, as appropriate. Choose the surgical intervention jointly with the person, taking into account:  the degree of obesity comorbidities the best available evidence on effectiveness and long-term effects the facilities and equipment available the experience of the surgeon who would perform the operation.Carry out a comprehensive preoperative assessment of any psychological or clinical factors that may affect adherence to postoperative care requirements (such as changes to diet) before performing surgery.For further information, see what NICE says on preoperative tests.For information on reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism see what NICE says on bariatric and gastrointestinal surgery in venous thromboembolism. subhead:OrlistatOrlistat may be used to maintain or reduce weight before surgery for people who have been recommended surgery as a first-line option, if it is considered that the waiting time for surgery is excessive.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research: single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy for treating morbid obesity laparoscopic gastric plication for the treatment of severe obesity.NICE has published guidance that implantation of a duodenal\u2013jejunal bypass sleeve for managing obesity should be used only in the context of research.subhead: Depth of anaesthesia  monitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on depth of anaesthesia monitors. The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.subhead:Medtech innovation briefingsNICE has published medtech innovation briefings on: End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys\u00a0closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia AccuVein\u00a0AV400 for vein visualisation.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Obesity: clinical assessment and management5Referring adults for bariatric surgery assessmentSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. Apportion part of local transport funding to promote walking, cycling and other forms of travel that involve physical activity. The proportion allocated should be in line with growth targets for the use of these modes of transport.Ensure cycle tracks created under the Cycle Tracks Act 1984 are part of the definitive map (the legal record of public rights of way).subhead:Local transport plans \u2013 young peopleChildren and young people: key themes Promoting the benefits of physical activity and encouraging participation  Ensuring high-level strategic policy planning for children and young people supports the physical activity agenda  Consultation with, and the active involvement of, children and young people  The planning and provision of spaces, facilities and opportunities  The need for a skilled workforce  Promoting physically active and sustainable travel.What action should be taken?Ensure local transport and school travel plans continue to be fully aligned with other local authority plans which may impact on children and young people s physical activity. Liaise with local partnerships to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active.Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans. This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road. Consider how these policies can be improved to encourage physically active travel.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

PCTs should ensure local education initiatives aimed at health professionals include information on the importance of folic acid supplements. They should provide the maternal Healthy Start vitamin supplements (folic acid, vitamins C and D) for eligible women. They should also ensure women who are not eligible for Healthy Start can obtain the supplements from their local pharmacy. GPs should prescribe 5 milligrams of folic acid a day for women who are planning a pregnancy, or are in the early stages of pregnancy, if they:  (or their partner) have a neural tube defect  have had a previous baby with a neural tube defect  (or their partner) have a family history of neural tube defects  have diabetes. subhead:Vitamin DEnsure health professionals recommend vitamin D supplementsLocal authorities, primary care and clinical commissioning groups should: Ensure computerised prompts on vitamin D are integrated into health and social care systems. Ensure health professionals recommend and record vitamin D supplement use among specific population groups  (and other family members, as appropriate) whenever possible. This could take place during registration appointments with new patients in general practice, flu, other vaccine and screening appointments. It could also take place during routine appointments and health checks including, for example: NHS Health Check diabetes check-ups falls appointments and check-ups health assessments for looked-after children the first contact with someone who is pregnant antenatal and postnatal appointments medicine use and prescription reviews health visitor appointments developmental checks for infants and children.Developers of standardised electronic and handheld maternity notes and developers of personal child health records (the  red book ) should add specific questions about the use of vitamin D supplements.All women should be informed at the booking appointment about the importance for their own and their baby s health of maintaining adequate vitamin D stores during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding. In order to achieve this, women should be advised to take a vitamin D supplement (10 micrograms of vitamin D per day), as found in the Healthy Start multivitamin supplement. Women who are not eligible for the Healthy Start benefit should be advised where they can buy the supplement. Particular care should be taken to enquire as to whether women at greatest risk are following advice to take this daily supplement. These include: women with darker skin (such as those of African, African\u2013Caribbean or South Asian family origin women who have limited exposure to sunlight, such as women who are housebound or confined indoors for long periods, or who cover their skin for cultural reasons.Testing vitamin D levelsHealth professionals should not routinely test people s vitamin D status unless:  they have symptoms of deficiency  they are considered to be at particularly high risk of deficiency (for example, they have very low exposure to sunlight)  there is a clinical reason to do so (for example, they have osteomalacia or have had a fall).Increase availability of vitamin D supplements for specific population groupsLocal authorities should ensure vitamin D supplements containing the recommended reference nutrient intake are widely available by:  Establishing arrangements with a range of settings to promote and distribute them. This could include local pharmacies, children s centres, midwifery and health visiting services and GP reception areas. Considering providing free supplements for specific population groups.  Encouraging pharmacies and other outlets selling food supplements (such as supermarkets) to stock the lowest cost vitamin D supplements and promote them to specific population groups.  Ensure improvements in the availability of vitamin D supplements are supported by local awareness-raising activities (see NICE s recommendations on raise awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplements and training and professional development in relation to vitamin D supplement use in specific population groups).subhead:Healthy StartHealth professionals should advise pregnant women and parents of children under 4 years about the Healthy Start scheme. They should ensure all women who may be eligible receive an application form as early as possible in pregnancy. Health professionals should use every opportunity they have to offer those parents who are eligible for the Healthy Start scheme practical, tailored information, support and advice on:  how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase their fruit and vegetable intake.Health professionals should offer the maternal Healthy Start vitamin supplement (folic acid, vitamins C and D) to pregnant women who are (or who may be) eligible. Community pharmacists should ensure the Healthy Start maternal vitamin supplements are available for purchase by women who are not eligible to receive them free of charge. Diet in pregnancyEarly in pregnancy, discuss the woman s diet and eating habits and find out and address any concerns she may have about her diet. Provide information on the benefits of a healthy diet and practical advice on how to eat healthily throughout pregnancy. This should be tailored to the woman s circumstances. The advice should include: eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and one portion of oily fish (for example, mackerel, sardines, pilchards, herring, trout or salmon) a week. subhead:Diet for breastfeedingAdvise mothers that a healthy diet is important for everyone and that they do not need to modify their diet to breastfeed.

Health professionals should continue to monitor, support and care for women with a BMI of 30 or more who join weight management groups and slimming clubs. Weight management groups and slimming clubs should adhere to the principles outlined in the recommendations for health professionals and local authorities about weight management programmes. This includes giving advice about healthy eating and the importance of physical activity and using evidence-based behaviour-change techniques to motivate and support women to lose weight.Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should advise women that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both them and their unborn child during pregnancy. They should also explain that it will help them to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth \u2013 and could encourage the whole family to eat healthily and be physically active.Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should encourage those who have weight concerns before, during or after pregnancy to talk to a health professional such as a GP, practice nurse, dietitian, health visitor or pharmacist.

For example, ensure: they are even and do not include any hazards, for example from tree roots, pot-holes, broken paving slabs or seasonal and weather-related obstructions they have enough lighting to make people feel secure they are free from permanent or temporary obstructions, where possible (see information on people with limited mobility in strategies, policies and plans)  they are not hidden by overgrown or poorly managed vegetation they have clear signs to help people find their way.Work in association with relevant third sector organisations and volunteers to plan and carry out this work. For more details, see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility and the Traffic signs manual. See why we made the recommendations on footways, footpaths and cycle routes.subhead:Streets and roadsEnsure pedestrians, cyclists and users of other modes of transport that involve physical activity are given the highest priority when developing or maintaining streets and roads. (This includes people with limited mobility.) Use 1 or more of the following methods: Re-allocate road space to support physically active modes of transport (for example, by widening footways and introducing cycle lanes). For more detail on designing these routes, see the recommendations on active travel in NICE s guidance on air pollution, and the Department for Transport s guidance on Shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Restrict motor vehicle access (for example, by closing or narrowing roads to reduce capacity).  Introduce road-user charging schemes. For more detail on charging schemes, see clean air and congestion charging zones in NICE s recommendations on air pollution. Introduce traffic-calming schemes to restrict vehicle speeds (using signage and changes to highway design). For more detail on traffic calming, see the recommendations on smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s guidance on air pollution, recommendations on promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s and Department for Transport s guidance on traffic calming.  See why we made the recommendations on streets and roads.subhead:Cycling infrastructureImprove cycling infrastructure using information from people who walk, cycle, and drive in the local area, including those with limited mobility. See strategies, policies and plans. Improvements may include: establishing cycle lanes, tracks and trails in line with best practice  installing secure cycle parking facilities in public places, on public transport and at public transport stops. For more details see NICE s recommendations on walking and cycling, and other guidance such as Transport for London s London cycling design standards and Highways England s Cycle traffic and the strategic road network.See why we made the recommendations on cycling infrastructure.subhead:People with limited mobilityMake it as easy as possible for people with limited mobility to move around their local area, and work with relevant third sector organisations to achieve this. For example: Ensure footways:  have even, non-reflective anti-glare surfaces are free from unauthorised and unnecessary obstructions (whether permanent or temporary) including being free from pavement parking (see strategies, policies and plans).  - are set back from traffic, if possible (for example, by a grass verge). Ensure footways that have a kerb clearly define the kerb with a change in level (apart from pedestrian crossings). Ensure pedestrian crossings have flush kerbs and tactile paving (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces). Ensure signal-controlled crossings have tactile rotating cones and, if appropriate, an audible beep, and give enough time to cross the road safely. Ensure tactile paving is correctly installed and maintained where it is needed, for example at all crossing places, at the top and bottom of stairs, on the edge of railway platforms and on shared use routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on tactile paving surfaces). Ensure seating is provided at regular intervals along footways that are key walking routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility.  See why we made the recommendations for people with limited mobility.subhead:School, college and early years settingsImprove routes that children, young people and their families and carers use, or could use, for active travel to school, college and early years settings. Focus on improving safety, accessibility, connectivity, sustainability and appeal to users. Consider improving access routes to school, college and early years settings by: improving footways and pedestrian crossings (see above)  introducing measures to reduce vehicle speed (see smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s recommendations on air pollution) and promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s).

First, a risk assessment should be offered (see below). Second, where necessary, a blood test should be offered to confirm whether people have type 2 diabetes or are at high risk (see offer a blood test). Service providers including pharmacists, managers of local health and community services and voluntary organisations, employers and leaders of faith groups should offer validated self-assessment questionnaires or validated web-based tools (for examples, see the Diabetes UK website). They should also provide the information needed to complete and interpret them. The tools should be available in local health, community and social care venues. Examples of possible health venues include: community pharmacies, dental surgeries, NHS walk-in centres and opticians. Examples of community and social care venues include: workplaces, job centres, local authority leisure services, shops, libraries, faith centres, residential and respite care homes and day centres (for older adults and for adults with learning disabilities). Public health, primary care and community services should publicise local opportunities for risk assessment and the benefits of preventing (or delaying the onset of) type 2 diabetes. The information should be up-to-date and provided in a variety of formats. It should also be tailored for different groups and communities. For example, by offering translation services and information in languages used locally. Where risk assessment is conducted by health professionals in NHS venues outside general practice (for example, in community pharmacies) the professionals involved should ensure the results are passed on to the person s GP. GPs should keep records of all risk assessment results to ensure appropriate follow-up and continuity of care. Where self-assessment is offered in community venues, health professionals and community practitioners in those venues should encourage people with an intermediate or high risk score to visit their GP to discuss how to manage their risk. Those at high risk should be offered a blood test by their GP.Ensure health professionals and community practitioners involved with risk assessments in community venues communicate closely with, and receive support from, NHS diabetes risk-assessment and prevention services. They should aim to ensure continuity of care and avoid unnecessary duplication of risk assessments. Managers in primary and secondary healthcare should ensure staff actively seek out and offer risk assessments to people who might not realise they could be at high risk. This includes people with particular conditions that can increase the risk such as: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome, a history of gestational diabetes and mental health problems. In addition, people with learning disabilities and those attending accident and emergency, emergency medical admissions units, vascular and renal surgery units and ophthalmology departments may be at high risk.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Are developed by a multidisciplinary team. This includes input from a registered dietitian, registered practitioner psychologist and a qualified physical activity instructor.  Ensure staff are trained to deliver them and they receive regular professional development sessions.  Focus on life-long lifestyle change and the prevention of future weight gain.  Last at least 3 months, and that sessions are offered at least weekly or fortnightly and include a  weigh-in  at each session. Ensure achievable goals for weight loss are agreed for different stages \u2013 including within the first few weeks, for the end of the programme or referral period (as appropriate) and for 1 year (see improve adherence and outcomes in this pathway).  Ensure specific dietary targets are agreed (for example, for a clear energy [calorie] intake or for a specific reduction in energy intake) tailored to individual needs and goals. Note: it is preferable not to  ban  specific foods or food groups \u2013 and the price of any recommended dietary approaches should not be prohibitive. Individual advice from a registered dietitian may be beneficial, but is not essential.  Ensure discussions take place about how to reduce sedentary behaviour and the type of physical activities that can easily be integrated into everyday life and maintained in the long term (for example, walking).  Ensure any supervised physical activity sessions are led by an appropriately qualified physical activity instructor and take into account any medical conditions people may have. Instructors should be on the Register of Exercise Professionals (or equivalent) at level 3 or above.  Use a variety of behaviour-change methods. These should address: problem solving; goal setting; how to carry out a particular task or activity; planning to provide social support or make changes to the social environment; self-monitoring of weight and behaviours that can affect weight; and feedback on performance. Tailor programmes to support the needs of different groups. For example, programmes should provide men- or women-only sessions as necessary; provide sessions at a range of times and in venues with good transport links or used by a particular community; and consider providing childcare for attendees. Monitor weight, indicators of behaviour change and participants  personal goals throughout the programme. Adopt a respectful, non-judgemental approach (see minimise harm in this pathway).

The person is generally fit for anaesthesia and surgery. The person commits to the need for long-term follow-up. The hospital specialist and/or bariatric surgeon should discuss the following with people who are severely obese if they are considering surgery to aid weight reduction: the potential benefits  the longer-term implications of surgery associated risks complications perioperative mortality.The discussion should also include the person s family, as appropriate. Choose the surgical intervention jointly with the person, taking into account:  the degree of obesity comorbidities the best available evidence on effectiveness and long-term effects the facilities and equipment available the experience of the surgeon who would perform the operation.Coordinate surgical care and follow-up around the child or young person and their family s needs.

The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Consider social norms, family practices and any fears people may have about the safety of areas where physical activities take place (this includes fears about how safe it is to travel there and back).Map physical activity opportunities against local needs and address any gaps in provision.Ensure commissioned leisure services are affordable and acceptable to those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This means providing affordable childcare facilities. It also means public transport links should be affordable and the environment should be culturally acceptable. For example, local authorities should consider the appropriateness of any videos and music played. They should also consider providing single-gender facilities, exercise classes, swimming sessions and walking groups \u2013 for both men and women. Provide information on local, affordable, practical and culturally acceptable opportunities to be more active. If cultural issues affect people s ability to participate, work with them to identify activities which may be acceptable. (This may include, for example, single-gender exercise and dance classes, or swimming sessions with same-gender lifeguards.) Encourage local employers to develop policies to encourage employees to be more physically active, for example, by using healthier modes of transport to and from work. Walking and cycling can be encouraged by providing showers and secure cycle parking. Signposting and improved decor could encourage employees to use the stairs rather than the lift. In addition, people could be encouraged to be active in lunch breaks and at other times through organised walks and subsidies for local leisure facilitiesThis is an extract from a recommendation that appears in obesity prevention (2006) NICE  guideline CG43 and a recommendation that appears in physical activity in the workplace (2008) NICE guideline PH13..

The aim should be to make the healthier choice the easiest and relatively cheaper choice. The retailers targeted may include regional and national supermarkets and convenience store chains, as well as street markets and small independent shops.Encourage local caterers to include details in menus on the calorie content of meals to help consumers make an informed choice.

Interventions should take into account the religious beliefs, cultural practices, age and gender, language and literacy of black, minority ethnic and lower socioeconomic groups. (Interventions costing up to \u00a310 per head would need to achieve an average weight loss of about 0.25 kg per head to be cost effective. Those costing up to \u00a3100 per head would need to achieve an average weight loss of about 1 kg per head.)Identify success criteria in the early stages of development to ensure interventions can be properly evaluated. Identify any skills gaps and train or recruit staff to fill the gaps.Identify and address barriers to participation. This includes developing communication strategies that are sensitive to the target audience s language and information requirements.Identify local resources and existing community groups that could help promote healthy eating, physical activity and weight management, particularly within local communities at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Use community resources to improve awareness of the key messages and to increase accessibility to the interventions. For example, involve community organisations and leaders at the development stage and use media, plan events or attend festivals specifically aimed at black and minority ethnic communities and lower socioeconomic groups. Also involve existing community and social groups or clubs, such as toddler groups, pubs, social clubs and local sports clubs. Where they exist, use community links, outreach projects and lay or peer workers (from black and minority ethnic communities and from lower socioeconomic groups) to deliver interventions.Where necessary, train lay and peer workers in how to plan, design and deliver community-based health promotion activities. Training should be based on proven training models and evaluation techniques. It should give participants the chance to practice their new skills in the community. It should also encourage them to pass on their knowledge to their peers.Lay and peer workers and health professionals should identify and encourage community champions (for example, religious and community leaders) to promote healthy eating and physical activity.Encourage lay and peer workers to get other members of their community involved.Ensure lay and peer workers are part of a wider team led by health professionals. They should be involved in the planning, design and delivery of credible and culturally appropriate messages. This includes helping people to develop the practical skills they need to adopt a healthier lifestyle. For example, they should be able to run nutrition education sessions (theory and practice) or physical activity sessions. Management and supervision of these activities should be provided by the health professionals leading these teams.Commission culturally appropriate and financially accessible weight management programmes either from the NHS or non-NHS providers, based on the guiding principles for effective weight-loss programmes. These should be provided in community settings in areas where populations at high risk of type 2 diabetes live. (For example, they could be provided in religious venues or community and social clubs.)Ensure the systems or initiatives used to assess someone from a high-risk community are culturally appropriate.Ensure identification and assessment systems or initiatives are linked to effective services and interventions for individuals deemed to be at high risk.See group and individual-level interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes among people at high risk.Align actions to prevent type 2 diabetes with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see what NICE says on obesity: working with local communities).See what NICE says on community engagement.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Use a locally approved comorbidities assessment tool, where available. Assessment is particularly important if the child or young person and their family have self-referred to the programme, or have not been assessed by a health professional. Refer them to their GP if any concerns are identified.  Identify whether the child or young person s mental wellbeing is affected by their weight. For example, whether there are any signs of psychological distress, depression, bulimia, self-harming or other mental health problems related to their weight.  Identify whether their weight is a consequence of circumstances that have affected their mental wellbeing. (For example, if they have experienced bereavement or have caring responsibilities.)  If concerns about their mental wellbeing are identified, refer the child or young person to their GP for assessment and treatment and, if appropriate, for onward referral to child and adolescent mental health services. (Note: such concerns may be identified at any stage of a weight management programme.) Take account of the child or young person s self-esteem, self-perception and any previous attempts to manage their weight. Provide opportunities, in either a group or one-to-one session, for them to talk about any victimisation or distress if they wish. (This includes any history of bullying or teasing.)  Find out whether the family recognises that their child is overweight or obese and the potential benefits of managing their weight. Discuss the family s history of attempts to manage their weight, and their existing knowledge of, and attitudes towards, food, physical activity and the amount of time spent being sedentary. Weigh, measure, determine and record the child or young person s body mass index (BMI). Offer to do the same for parents, carers and other family members. Measurements should be undertaken by staff who have been trained using standard protocols (see programme staff training in delivering programmes).  Use validated, transportable instruments that are regularly calibrated.  Emphasise that the programme may benefit the whole family. In addition, offer information about local lifestyle weight management services to adult family members who are overweight or obese.  Encourage children and young people from around the age of 12 (depending on their ability and stage of development) to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour. For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing. For younger children, parents and carers should monitor these behaviours, with the involvement of the child according to their age and stage of development.  Work with children from around the age of 12 (depending on their ability and stage of development) to identify situations in which it would be possible for them to eat more healthily or to become less sedentary and more active. For example, this might involve gradually reducing TV viewing at certain times and replacing this with more active pastimes. Work with the parents and carers of younger children to achieve the same.  Aim to gradually increase the amount of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity programme participants do every day. Focus on activities they enjoy and that are easily accessible. This includes activities that can be built into daily life, such as active play, walking or cycling. Aim to achieve the age-specific UK physical activity guidelines. Agree dietary changes that are age-appropriate, affordable, culturally sensitive and consistent with healthy eating advice. Ensure nutrient needs for growth and development are met by including healthier choices, in appropriate amounts, from each of the food groups (see NHS Choices Eatwell plate). Changes to diet should take into account the child or young person s likes and dislikes.  Manage expectations of what can be realistically achieved over the duration of the programme. Small but realistic goals should be mutually agreed with the child or young person and their family. These should relate to goals that they value and that motivate them to attend.  Work with participants and their families to regularly monitor progress against the goals and provide feedback. Praise progress and achievements and update the goals as the child or young person progresses through the programme. If they do not meet their goals, discuss the possible causes for this and modify them if necessary.  Stress the importance of maintaining changes, no matter how small, over the longer term. Encourage participants to take up offers of ongoing support (see lifestyle weight management programmes in providing ongoing support).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Use community engagement techniques with local families to identify any barriers and facilitators discouraging or encouraging the uptake and completion of programmes. Commission lifestyle weight management services to meet the needs of local children and young people, including those of different ages, different stages of development and from different cultural backgrounds. Services should be in line with the health and wellbeing strategy.  Consider how best to provide services for overweight or obese children and young people with special needs or disabilities. For example, through specific programmes where these are available. Or by making reasonable adaptations to mainstream programmes (including training staff) and evaluating them. Ensure there is an appropriate interface with Specialist obesity services to help those with more complex needs manage their weight.  Ensure all lifestyle weight management programmes are designed and developed with input from a multidisciplinary team and have taken into account the views of children, young people and their families. The team should include professionals who specialise in children, young people and weight management. These include the following:  a state-registered dietitian or registered nutritionist a physical activity specialist  a behaviour-change expert, such as a health promotion specialist (for physical activity, a sport and exercise psychologist may be appropriate)  a health or clinical psychologist, or a child or adolescent psychiatrist, to provide expertise in mental wellbeing a paediatrician or paediatric nurse. Ensure programme content is regularly reviewed and updated by the multidisciplinary team.  Ensure providers can demonstrate that staff are trained to deliver the specific programme commissioned and are experienced in working with children, young people and their families.  Ensure sufficient resources are dedicated to monitoring and evaluation.  Ensure there are clearly defined programme objectives, outputs, outcomes and monitoring and evaluation requirements in programme specifications and in contracts. Contracts should also specify any at-risk groups that should be targeted, such as black and minority ethnic groups, or children and young people from low income families or neighbourhoods.  Ensure key performance indicators are agreed with programme providers, including the proportion of sessions that must be attended to complete the programme (see   monitoring and evaluating the service). Ensure the contract or programme specification requires that height and weight are measured and that both body mass index (BMI) and BMI for age and gender (BMI z score) are recorded. All children and young people should be measured at the following times:  at recruitment to the programme at completion of the programme  6 months after completing the programme 1 year after completing the programme.

The commitment of middle managers and those with a strategic role is particularly important. For example, they should: be aware of, and committed to, the obesity agenda in the health and wellbeing strategy  be aware of the impact of obesity on other priorities (for example, the rising local incidence of type 2 diabetes, due to obesity).  Health and wellbeing board chairs and executive directors of local authority services should advocate for action on obesity in any discussions with partners or the local media. The local coordinator and public health teams should ensure the results of all monitoring and evaluation are made available to all those who can use them to inform their work, both in the local community and nationally. For example, log evaluation reports in the Obesity Learning Centre, healthy places databases or the NICE shared learning database.The local coordinator and communications leads should ensure information from monitoring and evaluation is accessible and easy to use by everyone in the community, including those involved with obesity prevention, local groups and networks, the media and the public.

Community pharmacists should ensure the Healthy Start maternal vitamin supplements are available for purchase by women who are not eligible to receive them free of charge. Diet in pregnancyEarly in pregnancy, discuss the woman s diet and eating habits and find out and address any concerns she may have about her diet. Provide information on the benefits of a healthy diet and practical advice on how to eat healthily throughout pregnancy. This should be tailored to the woman s circumstances. The advice should include: eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and one portion of oily fish (for example, mackerel, sardines, pilchards, herring, trout or salmon) a week. subhead:Diet for breastfeedingAdvise mothers that a healthy diet is important for everyone and that they do not need to modify their diet to breastfeed.

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child.Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute. What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable source. Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intakeThis is an edited extract from a recommendation that appears in Maternal and child nutrition  (NICE public health guidance 11).  of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments). Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy \u2013 see the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsNICE recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. See NICE s recommendations on obesity. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects. Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods.Explain to women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child. Explain that they should not try to reduce this risk by dieting while pregnant and that the risk will be managed by the health professionals caring for them during pregnancy.Offer women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more a referral to a dietician or appropriately trained health professional for assessment and personalised advice on healthy eating and how to be physically active. Encourage them to lose weight after pregnancy.subhead:Supporting women after childbirth During the 6-8-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache). Midwives and other health professionals should encourage women to breastfeed. They should reassure them that a healthy diet and regular, moderate-intensity physical activity and gradual weight loss will not adversely affect the ability to breastfeed or the quantity or quality of breast milk. Health professionals should give advice on recreational exercise from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In summary, this states that: If pregnancy and delivery are uncomplicated, a mild exercise programme consisting of walking, pelvic floor exercises and stretching may begin immediately. But women should not resume high-impact activity too soon after giving birth. After complicated deliveries, or lower segment caesareans, a medical care-giver should be consulted before resuming pre-pregnancy levels of physical activity, usually after the first check-up at 6-8 weeks after giving birth. Health professionals should also emphasise the importance of participating in physical activities, such as walking, which can be built into daily life. subhead:Community-based services Local authority leisure and community services should offer women with babies and children the opportunity to take part in a range of physical or recreational activities. This could include swimming, organised walks, cycling or dancing. Activities need to be affordable and available at times that are suitable for women with older children as well as those with babies. Where possible, affordable childcare (for example, a cr\u00e8che) should be provided and provision made for women who wish to breastfeed. Weight management groups and slimming clubs should adhere to the principles outlined at the beginning of this section. This includes giving advice about healthy eating and the importance of physical activity and using evidence-based behaviour-change techniques to motivate and support women to lose weight.Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should advise women that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both them and their unborn child during pregnancy. They should also explain that it will help them to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth \u2013 and could encourage the whole family to eat healthily and be physically active. Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should encourage those who have weight concerns before, during or after pregnancy to talk to a health professional such as a GP, practice nurse, dietician, health visitor or pharmacist. They should also advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice on healthy eating and physical activity from a reputable source. subhead:Professional skills Ensure health professionals, healthcare assistants and support workers have the skills to advise on the health benefits of weight management and risks of being overweight or obese before, during and after pregnancy, or after successive pregnancies. Ensure they can advise women on their nutritional needs before, during and after pregnancy and can explain why it is important to have a balanced diet and to be moderately physically active. Ensure they have behaviour change knowledge, skills and competencies. This includes being able to help people to identify how their behaviour is affecting their health, draw up an action plan, make the changes and maintain them. Ensure they have the communication techniques needed to broach the subject of weight management in a sensitive manner. They should be able to give women practical advice on how to improve their diet and become more physically active. They should be able to tailor this advice to individual needs and know when to refer them for specialist care and support. Ensure they have knowledge, skills and competencies in group facilitation, are aware of the needs of minority ethnic groups and have knowledge of local services. Ensure their training is regularly monitored and updated.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.The recommendations below should be implemented before those in CVD programme resources, leadership and evaluation.subhead:Good practice principlesEnsure a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programme comprises intense, multi-component interventions.Ensure it takes into account issues identified in this guidance. See also NICE s recommendations on cardiovascular disease prevention.Ensure it includes initiatives aimed at the whole population (such as local policy and regulatory initiatives) which complement existing programmes aimed at individuals at high risk of CVD.Ensure it is sustainable for a minimum of 5 years.Ensure appropriate time and resources are allocated for all stages, including planning and evaluation.subhead:PreparationGain a good understanding of the prevalence and incidence of CVD in the community. Find out about any previous CVD prevention initiatives that have been run (including any positive or negative experiences).Consider how existing policies relating to food, tobacco control and physical activity, including those developed by the local authority, may impact on the prevalence of CVD locally.Gauge the community s level of knowledge of, and beliefs about, CVD risk factors. This includes beliefs that smoking is the only solace in life for people with little money, or that only people who have a lot of money eat salad.Gauge how confident people in the community are that they can change their behaviour to reduce the risks of CVD. See NICE s recommendations on behaviour change.Identify groups of the population who are disproportionately affected by CVD and develop strategies with them to address their needs.Take into account the community s exposure to risk factors (factors currently facing adults and those emerging for children and younger people).subhead:Programme developmentDevelop a population-based approach. Ensure a  programme theory  is developed and used to underpin the programmeEvidence based policy: 2. The promise of  realist synthesis . This should cover the reasons why particular actions are expected to have particular outcomes.Ensure the programme helps address local targets and tackles health inequalities.Link the programme with existing strategies for targeting people at particularly high risk of CVD and take account of ongoing, accredited screening activities by GPs and other healthcare professionals. This includes the NHS Health Checks programme.Work closely with local authorities and other organisations covering specific areas to promote policies which are likely to encourage healthier eating, tobacco control and increased physical activity. Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups).When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations made within this guidance. Also see what NICE says on smoking, behaviour change, community engagement and diet. Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors. Media campaigns should be based on an acknowledged theoretical framework.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The strategy should ensure: there are local indoor and outdoor opportunities for physical activity where children and young people feel safe individuals responsible for increasing physical activity are aware of national and local government strategies as well as local plans for increasing physical activity partnership working is developed and supported within local physical activity networks physical activity partnerships establish and deliver multi-component interventions involving schools, families and communities. (Partners may include: schools, colleges, out-of-schoolOut-of-school services are defined as those providing activities that take place outside the formal school day, possibly as part of extended school services. They could involve using school facilities during the evening, weekends and school holidays. services, children s centres and play services, youth services, further education institutions, community clubs and groups and private sector providers) local factors that help children and young people to be (or which prevent them from being) physically active are identified and acted upon local transport and school travel plans are coordinated so that all local journeys can be carried out using a physically active mode of travel. See transport and physical activity. Ensure physical activity initiatives aimed at children and young people are regularly evaluated. Evaluations should measure uptake among different groups (for example, among those with disabilities or from different ethnic backgrounds). Any changes in physical activity, physical skills and health outcomes should be recorded. Identify a senior council member to be a champion for children and young people s physical activity. They should: promote the importance of encouraging physical activity as part of all council portfolios ensure physical activity is a key priority when developing local authority programmes and targets promote partnership working with council member leads of relevant departments (for example, transport, leisure and health) explain to the public the local authority s role in promoting physical activity.subhead:Developing physical activity plans for childrenIdentify groups of local children and young people who are unlikely to participate in at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. Work with the public health observatory, schools and established community partnerships and voluntary organisations to achieve this.Involve these children and young people in the design, planning and delivery of physical activity opportunities, using the information gathered.Consult with different groups of children and young people and their families on a regular basis to understand the factors that help or prevent them from being physically active. Pay particular attention to those who are likely to be less physically active. Ensure children and young people from different socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are actively involved in the provision of activities. Also ensure those with a disability (or who are living with a family member who has a disability) are actively involved.Use the information gathered to increase opportunities for children and young people to be physically active and to plan dedicated programmes that tackle any inequalities in provision. For further recommendations on community engagement, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement.subhead:Planning the provision of spaces and facilities for children Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels.Align actions to promote physical activity with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see NICE s recommendations on obesity: working with local communities).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instruction for activities aimed at children and young peopleEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment. (For example, advice on how they might help their child become involved in an activity.)

Provide information on patient support programmes. NICE has published an evidence summary on obese, overweight with risk factors: liraglutide (Saxenda).subhead:Orlistat Only prescribe orlistat as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who meet one of the following criteria: a BMI of 28 kg/m2 or more with associated risk factors a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. Continue orlistat therapy beyond 3 months only if the person has lost at least 5% of their initial body weight since starting drug treatment. Also see below for advice on targets for people with type 2 diabetes.Make the decision to use drug treatment for longer than 12 months (usually for weight maintenance) after discussing potential benefits and limitations with the person. The co-prescribing of orlistat with other drugs aimed at weight reduction is not recommended.  subhead:Naltrexone\u2013bupropionThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on naltrexone\u2013bupropion for managing overweight and obesity.Naltrexone\u2013bupropion is not recommended within its marketing authorisation for managing overweight and obesity in adults alongside a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.This recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with naltrexone\u2013bupropion that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. Adults having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.See why we made these recommendations on naltrexone\u2013bupropion.NICE has written information for the public on naltrexone\u2013bupropion.subhead:Continued prescribing and withdrawalPharmacological treatment may be used to maintain weight loss, rather than to continue to lose weight. If there is concern about micronutrient intake adequacy, a supplement providing the reference nutrient intake for all vitamins and minerals should be considered, particularly for vulnerable groups such as older people (who may be at risk of malnutrition) and young people (who need vitamins and minerals for growth and development).Offer support to help maintain weight loss to people whose drug treatment is being withdrawn; if they did not reach their target weight, their self-confidence and belief in their ability to make changes may be low.Monitor the effect of drug treatment and reinforce lifestyle advice and adherence through regular review.Consider withdrawing drug treatment in people who have not reached weight loss targets (see above for details).Rates of weight loss may be slower in people with type 2 diabetes, so less strict goals than those for people without diabetes may be appropriate.

However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .subhead:Physical activity at workMany employers recognise that they have an obligation to the health and wellbeing of their workforce. Investing in the health of employees can also bring business benefits such as reduced sickness absence, increased loyalty and better staff retention.NICE s recommendations aim to help employers and workplace health professionals prevent the diseases associated with a lack of physical activity. The recommendations alone will not reverse the current obesity epidemic or other health trends associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.subhead:What action should be taken?Encourage employees to walk, cycle or use another mode of transport involving physical activity to travel part or all of the way to and from work (for example, by developing a travel plan).Help employees to be physically active during the working day by: where possible, encouraging them to move around more at work (for example, by walking to external meetings) providing information about walking and cycling routes and encouraging them to take short walks during work breaks encouraging them to set goals on how far they walk and cycle and to monitor the distances they cover.Take account of the nature of the work and any health and safety issues.

Do not use unduly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced diets, because they are ineffective in the long term and can be harmful.Encourage people to improve their diet even if they do not lose weight, because there can be other health benefits.The main requirement of a dietary approach to weight loss is that total energy intake should be less than energy expenditure.Diets that have a 600 kcal/day deficit (that is, they contain 600 kcal less than the person needs to stay the same weight) or that reduce calories by lowering the fat content (low-fat diets), in combination with expert support and intensive follow-up, are recommended for sustainable weight loss. Consider low-calorie diets (800\u20131,600 kcal/day), but be aware these are less likely to be nutritionally complete. Do not routinely use very-low-calorie diets (800 kcal/day or less) to manage obesity (defined as BMI over 30).Only consider very-low-calorie diets, as part of a multicomponent weight management strategy, for people who are obese and who have a clinically assessed need to rapidly lose weight (for example, people who need joint replacement surgery or who are seeking fertility services). Ensure that: the diet is nutritionally complete the diet is followed for a maximum of 12 weeks (continuously or intermittently) the person following the diet is given ongoing clinical support.Before starting someone on a very-low-calorie diet as part of a multi-component weight management strategy: Consider counselling and assess for eating disorders or other psychopathology to make sure the diet is appropriate for them. Discuss the risks and benefits with them. Tell them that this is not a long-term weight management strategy, and that regaining weight may happen and is not because of their own or their clinician s failure. Discuss the reintroduction of food following a liquid diet with them.Provide a long-term multicomponent strategy to help the person maintain their weight after the use of a very-low-calorie diet (see lifestyle changes for adults who are overweight or obese in NICE s recommendations on obesity).Encourage people to eat a balanced diet in the long term, consistent with other healthy eating advice.

The Department of Health has published health impact assessment tools to help organisations including, where relevant, government departments, assess the impact of policies on the health of the population. Policy goalsEnsure government policy is assessed for its impact on CVD. Ensure any such assessments are adequately incorporated into the policy making process. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAssess (in line with the Cabinet Office recommendations) all public policy and programmes for the potential impact (positive and negative) on CVD and other related chronic diseases. In addition, assess the potential impact on health inequalities. Assessments should be carried out using health and policy impact assessment and other similar, existing tools.Monitor the outcomes of policy and programmes after the assessment and use them to follow up and amend future plans.Make health impact assessment mandatory in specific scenarios. (Note that strategic environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment and regulatory impact assessment are already mandatory in certain contexts.)See also the recommendations on local and regional health impact assessments.subhead:MonitoringContextCVD is responsible for around 33% of the observed gap in life expectancy among people living in areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators compared with those living elsewhere in England. Independent monitoring, using a full range of available data, is vital when assessing the need for additional measures to address such health inequalities, including those related to CVD. Policy goalEnsure all appropriate data are available for monitoring and analysis to inform CVD prevention policy. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEnsure data on CVD prevention is available for scrutiny by the public health community as a whole.Ensure new econometric data (including pooled consumer purchasing data) are rapidly made available by industry for monitoring and analysis by independent agencies.Use population surveys (including the National diet and nutrition survey [NDNS] and the Low income diet and nutrition survey [LIDNS]) and data from all relevant sources to monitor intake of nutrients for all population groups. (Sources include: the Department of Health, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Office for National Statistics, the Public Health Observatories, academic and other researchers.)Monitor the intake of salt, trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids among different population groups and report the findings for those groups.Support the National diet and nutrition survey and the Low income diet and nutrition survey. Ensure the CVD module (including lipid profile measures) routinely appears in the Health surveys for England.Develop an international public health information system (resembling GLOBALink) for CVD prevention and use it to ensure widespread dissemination of these data.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The burden of diet-related disease has grown considerably since CAP was first implemented. CAP reform offers a significant opportunity to address the burden of CVD. However, there are still a number of significant  distortions  in relation to certain food prices and production processes which potentially increase the burden of disease. Further reform should aim to remove these distortions to promote health and wellbeing and to provide a basis for UK government action to prevent CVDLloyd Williams F, Mwatsama M, Birt C et al. (2008) Estimating the cardiovascular mortality burden attributable to the European Common Agricultural Policy on dietary saturated fats. Geneva: World Health Organization. Lock K, Pomerleau J (2005) Fruit and vegetable policy in the European Union: its effect on cardiovascular disease. Brussels: European Health Network.. The CAP has two main  pillars : market measures (first pillar) and rural development policy (second pillar). Recent CAP reform has shifted money from the first to the second pillar which now focuses more on  public goods . However, health has not been formally recognised as a  public good . CAP reforms have begun to address this issue, but a clearer focus on CVD and its antecedents (that is, the production of foods high in fat, sugar or salt) is needed.subhead:Policy goalsEnsure promoting health and reducing disease is made an explicit part of the CAP s  public goods  so that European money promotes the wellbeing of EU citizens. (The scope of what are regarded as  European public goods  in the EU is broader than the strict definition of a  public good  used by some economists.)Ensure CAP spending takes adequate account of its potential impact on CVD risk factors and is used in a way that optimises the public health outcomes. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsNegotiate at EU and national level to ensure the CAP takes account of public health issues. Health benefits should be an explicit, legitimate outcome of CAP spending. This can be achieved through formal recognition of health as a  public good .Progressively phase out payments under  pillar one  so that all payments fall under  pillar two . This will allow for better protection of health, climate and the environment. It will also improve and stimulate economic growth.Encourage the principle that future  pillar two  funds should reward or encourage the production of highly nutritious foods such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains and leaner meats.Negotiate to ensure the European Commission s impact assessment procedure takes cardiovascular health and other health issues into account.

To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.subhead:Recommended actionsEstablish the single, integrated, front-of-pack traffic light colour-coded system developed by the Food Standards Agency as the national standard for food and drink products sold in England. This includes the simple, traffic light, colour-coding visual icon and text which indicates whether food or drink contains a  high ,  medium  or  low  level of salt, fat or sugar. It also includes text to indicate the product s percentage contribution to the guideline daily amount (GDA) from each category.Consider using legislation to ensure universal implementation of the front-of-pack traffic light labelling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.Develop and implement nutritional labelling for use on shelves or packaging for bread, cakes, meat and dairy products displayed in a loose or unwrapped state or packed on the premises. The labelling should be consistent with the traffic light labelling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.Ensure food and drink labelling is consistent in format and content. In particular, it should refer to salt (as opposed to sodium), the content per 100 g and use kcals as the measure of energy.Continue to support the Department of Health in providing clear information about healthy eating.Ensure the UK continues to set the standard of best practice by pursuing exemption from potentially less effective EU food labelling regulations when appropriate.

Dedicated resources should be allocated for action.subhead:Strategy for senior managers and budget holdersLocal authorities should set an example in developing policies to prevent obesity in their role as employers, by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy. On-site catering should promote healthy food and drink choices (for example by signs, posters, pricing and positioning of products).Local authorities (including planning, transport and leisure services) should engage with the local community, to identify environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating. This should involve:  an audit, with the full range of partners including commissioners of health services, residents, businesses and institutions  assessing (ideally by doing a health impact assessment) the affect of their policies on the ability of their communities to be physically active and eat a healthy diet; the needs of subgroups should be considered because barriers may vary by, for example, age, gender, social status, ethnicity, religion and whether an individual has a disability.Barriers identified in this way should be addressed.Local authorities should facilitate links between health professionals and other organisations to ensure that local public policies improve access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity. Local authorities, through local partnerships, should encourage all local shops, supermarkets and caterers to promote healthy food and drink, for example by signs, posters, pricing and positioning of products, in line with existing guidance and (in England) with the local obesity strategy.subhead:Use of public money to buy food and drink in private sector venuesWhen public money is used to procure food and drink in venues outside the direct control of the public sector, ensure those venues provide a range of affordable healthier options (including from vending machines). Ideally, the healthier options should be cheaper than the less healthy alternatives. For instance, carbonated or sweetened drinks should not be the only options and fruit and water should be available at an affordable price. (Examples of when public money is used in this way include school visits to museums, sports centres, cinemas and fun parks.)subhead:Sponsorship in private and public sector venuesEncourage venues frequented by children and young people and supported by public money to resist sponsorship or product placement from companies associated with foods high in fat, sugar or salt.

They should all be implemented, following the order set out below and in conjunction with the recommendations for national policy, which they support. The aim is to plan, develop and maintain effective programmes.subhead:Good practice principlesEnsure a CVD prevention programme comprises intense, multi-component interventions.Ensure it takes into account issues identified in the recommendations for national policy.Ensure it includes initiatives aimed at the whole population (such as local policy and regulatory initiatives) which complement existing programmes aimed at individuals at high risk of CVD.Ensure it is sustainable for a minimum of 5 years.Ensure appropriate time and resources are allocated for all stages, including planning and evaluation.subhead:PreparationGain a good understanding of the prevalence and incidence of CVD in the community. Find out about any previous CVD prevention initiatives that have been run (including any positive or negative experiences).Consider how existing policies relating to food, tobacco control and physical activity, including those developed by the local authority, may impact on the prevalence of CVD locally.Gauge the community s level of knowledge of, and beliefs about, CVD risk factors. This includes beliefs that smoking is the only solace in life for people with little money, or that only people who have a lot of money eat salad.Gauge how confident people in the community are that they can change their behaviour to reduce the risks of CVD. (See what NICE says on behaviour change.)Identify groups of the population who are disproportionately affected by CVD and develop strategies with them to address their needs.Take into account the community s exposure to risk factors (factors currently facing adults and those emerging for children and younger people).subhead:Programme developmentDevelop a population-based approach.Ensure a  programme theory  is developed and used to underpin the programmePawson R (2001) Evidence based policy: 2.

This should cover the reasons why particular actions are expected to have particular outcomes.Ensure the programme helps address local targets and tackles health inequalities.Link the programme with existing strategies for targeting people at particularly high risk of CVD and take account of ongoing, accredited screening activities by GPs and other healthcare professionals. This includes the NHS Health Checks programme.Work closely with regional and local authorities and other organisations to promote policies which are likely to encourage healthier eating, tobacco control and increased physical activity. Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups).When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations in this guidance, and the NICE guidance on  behaviour change community engagement  maternal and child nutrition physical activity smoking.Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors. Media campaigns should be based on an acknowledged theoretical framework.subhead:ResourcesEnsure the programme lasts a minimum of 5 years (while subject to annual evaluation reports) to maximise its potential impact.Produce a long-term plan \u2013 and gain political commitment \u2013 for funding to ensure the programme has adequate resources and is sustainable beyond the end of the research or evaluation period.Ensure the programme is adequately staffed. Avoid adding CVD prevention to the workload of existing staff without relieving them of other tasks.Ensure volunteers are an additional (rather than a core) resource and that their training and support is adequately resourced.Ensure steps are taken to retain staff.Where staff are recruited from the local community ensure, as far as possible, that they reflect the local culture and ethnic mix.Ensure there are effective links with other existing and relevant community initiatives. subhead:LeadershipAct as leader and governor of CVD prevention.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Responding to children and young peopleIdentify local factors that may affect whether or not children and young people are physically active by regularly consulting with them, their parents and carers.Find out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instructionEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment. (For example, advice on how they might help their child become involved in an activity.)

Ensure they are inclusive, progressive and enjoyable. The activities should develop the child s movement skills (such as crawling, running, hopping, skipping, climbing, throwing, catching and kicking a ball). Children should also experience more advanced activities such as swimming, cycling, playing football and dancing.Provide opportunities at intervals throughout the day in pre-school establishments; during playtimes and lunch breaks at school; as part of extra-curricular and extended school provision; and during leisure time (including weekends and holidays) in wider community settings and the private sector.Help children identify activities they can enjoy by themselves and those they can enjoy with their friends and families.subhead:Helping girls and young women to be activeSupport participants of all abilities in a non-judgemental and inclusive way. Emphasise the opportunities for participation, enjoyment and personal development, rather than focusing on the evaluation of performance.Encourage those who initially choose not to participate to be involved with physical activities in other ways. Help them move gradually towards full participation.Encourage a dress code that minimises their concerns about body image. It should be practical, affordable and acceptable to them, without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide appropriate role models.subhead:Helping families to be activeEnsure parents and carers are aware of government advice that children and young people should undertake a minimum of 60 minutes moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. Make them aware that, at least twice a week, this should include activities to improve bone health, muscle strength and flexibility.Provide information and advice on the benefits of physical activity, emphasising how enjoyable it is. Provide examples of local opportunities.Encourage parents and carers to get involved in physical activities with their children.Encourage parents and carers to complete at least some local journeys (or some part of a local journey) with young children using a physically active mode of travel. This should take place on most days of the week. The aim is to establish physically active travel (such as walking or cycling) as a life-long habit from an early age. Parents and carers should also be encouraged to allow their children to become more independent, by gradually allowing them to walk, cycle or use another physically active mode of travel for short distances.Act as a role model by incorporating physical activity into daily life. For example, opt for travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling), use the stairs and regularly participate in recreational activities or sport.Promote physically active travel as an option for all the family.

This includes local partnership agreements, local area play strategies and healthy school plans. Liaise with local partners to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active. Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans (see recommendation below). This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Organise training courses for school travel plan advisers.Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road. Consider how these policies can be improved to encourage physically active travel.subhead:Active and sustainable school travel plansContinue to encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as walking or cycling).Develop a school travel plan which has physical activity as a key aim \u2013 see Making school travel plans work. Integrate it with the travel plans of other local schools and the local community (see above). The aim is to encourage children and young people to choose physically active modes of travel throughout their school career.Ensure schools provide suitable cycle and road safety training for all pupils.Encourage children and young people, especially those who live within a 2-mile radius of their school or other community facilities, to walk, cycle or use another mode of physically active travel to get there.Work with local authorities to map safe routes to school and to local play and leisure facilities. Take into account the views of pupils, parents and carers and consult with the local community. Overcome any barriers that are identified (for example, a lack of secure cycle parking).Involve children and young people, their parents and carers, the local community and external agencies in implementing the school travel plan. Use a mix of measures to promote it (for example, walking buses, walk and bike to school days). Work with the local authority school travel plan adviser to recruit volunteers on a long-term basis to help implement it.Set performance targets for school travel plans which are audited annually and which form part of delivery plans for local partnerships. Remedial action should be taken when agreed targets are not reached.Develop parents  and carers  awareness of the wider benefits of walking and cycling and other physically active modes of travel. For example, explain how it can improve children and young people s movement skills, social wellbeing, self-confidence and independence. Also explain how it can help children to explore and become more familiar (and at ease) with their local environment while, at the same time, being physically active.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The aim is to develop their risk awareness and an understanding of their own abilities as necessary life skills.Ensure children have the opportunity to explore a range of physical activities to help them identify those they can enjoy by themselves and those they can do with friends and family.Provide daily opportunities for participation in physically active play by providing guidance and support, equipment and facilities. Keep children motivated to be physically active by updating and varying the way physical activities are delivered (including the resources and environments used).Ensure opportunities are available after school, at weekends, during half-term breaks and during the longer school holidays. Activities should be led by appropriately trained and qualified staff (paid or voluntary) and take place in schools and other community settings.subhead:Supporting girls and young womenConsult with girls and young women to find out what type of physical activities they prefer.

For example, the programme should offer practical learning opportunities, particularly for those who have difficulties with communication or literacy or whose first language is not English.Ensure programmes are delivered by practitioners with relevant knowledge and skills who have received externally accredited training (see training to carry out diabetes risk assessments and interventions). Where relevant expertise is lacking, involve health professionals and specialists (such as dietitians and health psychologists) in the design and delivery of services. Ensure programmes adopt a person-centred, empathy-building approach. This includes finding ways to help participants make gradual changes by understanding their beliefs, needs and preferences. It also involves building their confidence and self-efficacy over time. Ensure programme components are delivered in a logical progression. For example: discussion of the risks and potential benefits of lifestyle change; exploration of someone s motivation to change; action planning; self-monitoring and self-regulation.Ensure groups meet at least eight times over a period of 9\u201318 months. Participants should have at least 16 hours of contact time either within a group, on a one-to-one basis or using a mixture of both approaches. Offer more intensive support at the start of the programme by delivering core sessions frequently (for example, weekly or fortnightly). Reduce the frequency of sessions over time to encourage more independent lifestyle management.

For example, refer someone to a dietitian for assessment and specialist dietary advice if required. Offer follow-up sessions at regular intervals (for example, every 3 months) for at least 2 years following the initial intervention period. The aim is to reinforce the positive behaviour change and to provide support, in case of relapse. Larger group sizes may be feasible for these maintenance sessions.Link the programmes with weight management and other prevention initiatives that help people to change their diet or become more physically active.subhead:ContentIntensive lifestyle-change programmes should offer ongoing tailored advice, support and encouragement to help people: undertake a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week gradually lose weight to reach and maintain a BMI within the healthy range increase their consumption of wholegrains, vegetables and other foods that are high in dietary fibre reduce the total amount of fat in their diet eat less saturated fat.Established behaviour-change techniques should be used (see what NICE says on behaviour change), including at least all of the following: Information provision: to raise awareness of the benefits of, and types of, lifestyle changes needed to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, building on what participants already know. Exploration and reinforcement of participants  reasons for wanting to change and their confidence about making changes. This may include using motivational interviewing or similar techniques suitably adapted for use in groups.  Goal-setting: prompting participants to set achievable and personally relevant short- and long-term goals (for example, to lose 5\u201310% of their weight in 1 year is a realistic initial target, or to be more physically active).  Action planning: prompting participants to produce action plans detailing what specific physical activity or eating behaviour they intend to change \u2013 and when, where and how this will happen. They should start with achievable and sustainable short-term goals and set graded tasks (starting with an easy task and gradually increasing the difficulty as they progress towards their goal). The aim is to move over time towards long-term, lifestyle change.  Coping plans and relapse prevention: prompting participants to identify and find ways to overcome barriers to making permanent changes to their exercise and eating habits. This could include the use of strategies such as impulse-control techniques (to improve management of food cravings).Participants in intensive lifestyle-change programmes should be encouraged to involve a family member, friend or carer who can offer emotional, information, planning or other practical support to help them make the necessary changes. For example, they may be able to join the participant in physical activities, help them to plan changes, make or accept changes to the family s diet or free up the participant s time so they can take part in preventive activities. (It may sometimes be appropriate to encourage the participant to get support from the whole family.)Participants should be encouraged to use self-regulation techniques. This includes self-monitoring (for example, by weighing themselves, or measuring their waist circumference or both). They should also review their progress towards achieving their goals, identify and find ways to solve problems and then revise their goals and action plans, where necessary.

However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.subhead:Policy and planning to encourage physical activityDevelop an organisation-wide plan or policy to encourage and support employees to be more physically active. This should: include measures to maximise the opportunity for all employees to participate be based on consultation with staff and should ensure they are involved in planning and design, as well as monitoring activities, on an ongoing basis be supported by management and have dedicated resources set organisational goals and be linked to other relevant internal policies (for example, on alcohol, smoking, occupational health and safety, flexible working or travel) link to relevant national and local policies (for example, on health or transport).subhead:Implementing a physical activity programmeIntroduce and monitor an organisation-wide, multi-component programme to encourage and support employees to be physically active. This could be part of a broader programme to improve health. It could include: flexible working policies and incentive schemes policies to encourage employees to walk, cycle or use other modes of transport involving physical activity (to travel to and from work and as part of their working day) the dissemination of information (including written information) on how to be more physically active and on the health benefits of such activity. This could include information on local opportunities to be physically active (both within and outside the workplace) tailored to meet specific needs, for example, the needs of shift workers ongoing advice and support to help people plan how they are going to increase their levels of physical activity the offer of a confidential, independent health check administered by a suitably qualified practitioner and focused on physical activity.subhead:Components of the physical activity programmeEncourage employees to walk, cycle or use another mode of transport involving physical activity to travel part or all of the way to and from work (for example, by developing a travel plan).Help employees to be physically active during the working day by: where possible, encouraging them to move around more at work (for example, by walking to external meetings) putting up signs at strategic points and distributing written information to encourage them to use the stairs rather than lifts if they can providing information about walking and cycling routes and encouraging them to take short walks during work breaks encouraging them to set goals on how far they walk and cycle and to monitor the distances they cover.Take account of the nature of the work and any health and safety issues. For example, many people already walk long distances during the working day, while those involved in shift work may be vulnerable if walking home alone at night.subhead:Travel plans, showers and secure cycle parking In their role as employers, NHS organisations should set an example in developing public health policies to prevent and manage obesity by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy. In particular, there should be policies, facilities and information that promote physical activity, for example, through travel plans, by providing showers and secure cycle parking and by using signposting and improved d\u00e9cor to encourage stair use.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Where appropriate and feasible, this should be provided on the employer s premises. It could involve providing information on, or links to, local resources. It could also involve providing advice and other information or resources (for example, the services of physical activity experts).If initial demand exceeds the resources available, focus on: enterprises where a high proportion of employees are from a disadvantaged background enterprises where a high proportion of employees are sedentary small and medium-sized enterprises. subhead:Local authoritiesLocal authorities should set an example in developing policies to prevent obesity in their role as employers, by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy.Physical activity should be promoted, for example through travel plans, by providing showers and secure cycle parking and using signposting and improved d\u00e9cor to encourage stair use.subhead:Supportive policies and practicesWorkplaces should provide opportunities for staff to be more physically active through:  working practices and policies, such as active travel policies for staff and visitors a supportive physical environment, such as improvements to stairwells and providing showers and secure cycle parking recreational opportunities, such as supporting out-of-hours social activities, lunchtime walks and use of local leisure facilities.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Obesity in adults: prevention and lifestyle weight management programmes quality standard1Vending machines3Prominent placement of healthy optionsSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The recommendations alone will not reverse the current obesity epidemic or other health trends associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.What action should be taken?Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Public open spacesSee recommendations on making public spaces accessible and appealing in public open spaces.subhead:General environmental improvementsA national framework for actionCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem. Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. It also includes developing and implementing public sector workplace travel plans that incorporate physical activity \u2013 see physical activity programmes including active travel. Encourage and support employers in other sectors to do the same.Ensure the need for children and young people to be physically active is addressed. This includes providing adequate play spaces and opportunities for formal and informal physical activity.Audit bye-laws and amend those that prohibit physical activity in public spaces (such as those that prohibit ball games).Align all  planning gain  agreements with the promotion of heart health to ensure there is funding to support physically active travel.

They should ensure it is delivered through services operating across the NHS, local authorities and other organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors. Health and wellbeing boards and public health commissioners should regularly evaluate services in the context of these recommendations and changing local needs. They should use local accountability mechanisms (for example, health scrutiny reports) to examine specific issues. Health and wellbeing boards and public health commissioners should evaluate or compare the different service options and make the findings publicly available.

This should include relevant local authority and NHS services, voluntary and community organisations and the private sector. Directors of public health should support leaders at all levels (including senior and middle managers and frontline staff) of all the partnerships involved in local action on obesity, to ensure local people and organisations are empowered to take action. This means: providing regular opportunities for partners to meet and share learning in both formal meetings and informal, open environments, as appropriate  addressing any overlapping, fragmented or competing agendas among different partners and considering options to enhance cooperation and joint working (options might include workshops or away days) funding small-scale community-led projects such as local gardening, cooking and walking groups; and exploring how such initiatives can contribute to defined long-term goals and can be evaluated in a proportionate way  fostering a  learning culture  by explicitly supporting monitoring and evaluation, especially for innovative interventions, and allowing partnerships to build on effective action and change or discard less effective solutions (see planning systems for monitoring and evaluation and implementing monitoring and evaluation in this pathway).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Further weight loss, to achieve a BMI within the healthy range (between 24.9 and 18.5 kg/m2) should also be encouraged, using evidence-based behaviour change techniques. Losing weight to within this range may be difficult and women will need to be motivated and supported.Health professionals should encourage women to check their weight and waist measurement periodically or, as a simple alternative, check the fit of their clothes. Health professionals should offer a weight loss support programme involving diet and physical activity. The programme should follow the principles of good practice, as outlined in self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes.Health professionals should offer specific dietary advice in preparation for pregnancy, including the need to take daily folic acid supplements.

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child. Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute.What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable sourceReputable sources of information and advice about diet and physical activity for women before, during and after pregnancy include:  The pregnancy book  (Department of Health (2009) The pregnancy book. London: Department of Health),  Birth to five  (Department of Health (2009) Birth to five. London: Department of Health) and the  Eat well guide . .Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments).Dispel any myths about what and how much to eat during pregnancy. For example, advise that there is no need to  eat for two  or to drink full-fat milk. Explain that energy needs do not change in the first 6 months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last 3 months (and then only by around 200 calories per day).Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy (see the RCOG advice on physical activity):  recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial  the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness  if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsThe NICE guideline on obesity prevention (CG43) recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects.Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods. Measure weight and height at the first contact with the pregnant woman, being sensitive to any concerns she may have about her weight. If these data are not available at their first booking appointment, then the midwife should do this. Do not rely on self-reported measures of weight and height. Clearly explain why this information is needed and how it will be used to plan her care. Weigh her in light clothing using appropriate, calibrated weighing scales that are regularly checked. Calculate BMI by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m2), or use the BMI calculator after measuring and weighing. Use BMI percentile charts for pregnant women under 18 years, as a BMI measure alone does not take growth into account and is inappropriate for this age group.Weight, height and BMI should be recorded in notes, the woman s hand-held record and the patient information system. If a hand-held record is not available, use local protocols to record this information.Do not weigh women repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. Only weigh again if clinical management can be influenced or if nutrition is a concern.subhead:Supporting women after childbirthUse the 6\u20138-week postnatal check as an opportunity to discuss the woman s weight. Ask those who are overweight, obese or who have concerns about their weight if they would like any further advice and support now \u2013 or later. If they say they would like help later, they should be asked whether they would like to make an appointment within the next 6 months for advice and support.During the 6\u20138-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache).Health professionals should advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice from a reputable source. Women who want support to lose weight should be given details of appropriate community-based services.See also what NICE says on physical activity.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

All providers of risk assessments should explain to those attending for a type 2 diabetes risk assessment the implications of being at high risk and the consequences of developing the condition. All providers of risk assessments should discuss with those attending for a type 2 diabetes risk assessment how to prevent or delay the onset of the condition. This includes being more physically active, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, eating less fat and eating more dietary fibre. They should also tell people where to get advice and support to maintain these lifestyle changes in the long term.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Ensure this training addresses staff attitudes to, and any concerns about, their own weight. Train staff to communicate effectively with, and generally adopt a respectful and non-judgemental approach to, participants. They should work collaboratively with them. This means they should understand the complexity of weight management and the reasons why many people have difficulty managing their weight, the experiences they may face in relation to their weight, and the fact that they may feel anxious about attending the programme. They should also be clear and open about what the programme involves, so that participants can make an informed choice about whether or not to join.  Train staff to deliver multicomponent programmes that cover weight management, dietary habits, safe physical activity and behaviour-change strategies. This should include the ability to: tailor interventions to individual needs (considering, for example, any specific language or literacy needs) review progress and provide constructive feedback to both participants and referrers identify possible reasons for relapse and use problem-solving techniques to address these collect information about people s weight, eating habits and physical activity to support monitoring in line with the Department of Health s information governance and data protection requirements (for example, see the Public Health Services Contract 2014/15: guidance on the non-mandatory contract for public health services.) Train staff to accurately measure and record height and weight to determine BMI and to accurately measure waist circumference. They should also be sensitive to how people feel about being measured and able to identify when it is practical, relevant and appropriate to measure someone. Ensure staff are aware of the common medical and psychological problems associated with being overweight or obese. Ensure staff are aware of evidence on the effect of dietary habits and physical activity on weight gain, loss and maintenance. Ensure staff are aware of the practical skills and behaviours that can help someone lose or maintain their weight. This includes, for example, shopping and cooking skills, understanding food labels and knowing what constitutes an appropriate portion of food. It also includes being able to identify opportunities to be less sedentary and more physically active. Train staff to identify when a participant should be referred to their GP for potential onward referral to other services (for example, specialist weight management or other specialist services, such as alcohol counselling).  Ensure staff leading supervised physical activity sessions are qualified and insured (for example, they should be trained to at least level 3 on the Register of Exercise Professionals or equivalent).

In addition, everyone should be encouraged to: Reduce the overall energy density of the diet. Practical ways to achieve this may include:  reducing how often energy dense foods and drinks (such as fried foods, biscuits, savoury snacks, confectionery and drinks made with full fat milk or cream) are eaten substituting energy dense items with foods and drinks with a lower energy density (such as fruit and vegetables or water)  using food and drink labels to choose options lower in fat and sugar choosing smaller portions or avoiding additional servings of energy dense foods.  Limit consumption of energy-dense food and drinks prepared outside the home, particularly fast or takeaway foods.  Avoid sugary drinks (including carbonated drinks, sports drinks, squashes and any other drinks that contain free sugars). Everyone should be encouraged to choose water or other drinks that do not contain free sugars. Other suitable drinks may include coffee, tea or drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners, such as diet versions of carbonated drinks or squashes. Reduce total fat intake. Practical ways of doing this may include choosing lower fat options of the main sources of fat in the diet, reducing portion size or frequency of consumption of foods high in fat (such as meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, fats and oils, and baked foods such as pizza, biscuits and cakes).  Eat breakfast but do not increase overall daily energy intake. Breakfast choices should reflect existing healthy eating advice. Practical ways to achieve this may include opting for unsweetened wholegrain cereals or bread, lower fat milk and a portion of fruit.  Increase the proportion of high fibre or wholegrain foods eaten. Practical ways to do this may include: choosing wholemeal bread and pasta and wholegrain rice instead of  white  versions opting for higher-fibre foods (such as oats, fruit and vegetables, beans, peas and lentils) in place of food and drinks high in fat or sugar.  Limit intake of meat and meat products. Follow existing advice from NHS Choices to eat no more than 70 g of red and processed meat a day. Practical ways to do this may include reducing the portion size of meat or how often meals including meat are eaten.

Where there are concerns about a child or young person s weight, weigh them in light clothing on clinically approved, regularly calibrated scales. In children older than 2 years, measure their height using a stadiometer. (See the Standard evaluation framework for weight management interventions, page 32, for practical advice on weighing and measuring children). Use the UK growth charts for children aged 4 years and older to determine BMI centile for their age and gender. Use the UK-WHO 0-4 years growth chart to determine if children younger than 4 are a healthy weight. Record this in the child or young person s health record. Take account of their Body mass index (BMI) centile, any obesity-associated diseases or conditions (comorbidities) they may have, or family medical history, and any psychosocial considerations, to determine whether referral to a lifestyle weight management programme is clinically appropriate.  Use tact and diplomacy to find out if the family and the child or young person accepts that the child or young person is overweight or obese. If they do accept this and it is clinically appropriate to refer them to a lifestyle weight management programme, explain the potential benefits they will gain \u2013 and the risks of not addressing their child s weight. In addition:  identify and address any fears or concerns the child, young person or their family may have about attending (for example, fears of being the largest child on the programme, of having to do very strenuous activities, or being stigmatised for attending)  give the family information about the programme, or tell them where they can get this information  explain what can be realistically expected in terms of results over the duration of the programme itself (for example, explain that for growing children, maintaining their existing weight may be a realistic short-term aim)  explain that the more sessions of a programme they attend, the greater the likelihood of success.  Assess whether the child or young person and their family are ready and willing to be referred. If they are ready, refer them to an effective lifestyle weight management programme (see core components of the programme). If the family is not ready to attend a programme: tell them how they can enrol in the future (including the fact that they can self-refer if this is possible) offer a follow-up appointment in 3 or 6 months, according to their preference provide them with, or point them to, information and advice on healthy eating, physical activity and how to reduce sedentary behaviour (examples include: the NHS Choices Eatwell plate, UK physical activity guidelines and the Change4Life website).  If children or young people need specialist support to manage their weight, refer them to specialist obesity services (if available) or to paediatric services.  If there are concerns about the child or young person s mental wellbeing related to their weight, use the local pathway to refer them to child and adolescent mental health services. Ensure their GP is informed. See also what NICE says on diabetes.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
