SecurAcath is easy to insert, well tolerated, associated with a low incidence of catheter-related complications and does not usually need removing while the catheter is in place.SecurAcath should be considered for any PICC with an anticipated medium- to long-term dwell time (15 days or more).Cost modelling shows that SecurAcath is cost saving compared with adhesive securement devices if the PICC remains in place for 15 days or longer. Estimated cost savings range from \u00a39 to \u00a395 per patient for dwell times of 25 days and 120 days, respectively. Cost savings result from shorter maintenance times and less need for device replacement with SecurAcath. Annual savings across the NHS from using SecurAcath are estimated to be around \u00a31 million.subhead:The 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sitesThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites.The case for adopting the 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing for central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites is supported by the evidence. This technology allows observation, and provides antiseptic coverage, of the catheter insertion site. It reduces catheter-related bloodstream infections and local site infections compared with semipermeable transparent (standard) dressings. It can be used with existing care bundles.The 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing should be considered for use in critically ill adults who need a central venous or arterial catheter in intensive care or high dependency units.The estimated cost saving from using a 3M Tegaderm CHG IV securement dressing (Tegaderm CHG) instead of a standard transparent semipermeable dressing is \u00a373 per patient. This estimate is based on a baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate of 1.48 per 1000 catheter days. Tegaderm CHG is estimated to be cost neutral when the baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate is 0.24 per 1000 catheter days, and cost incurring when the baseline rate falls below that figure. Estimates of the population for Tegaderm CHG based on adult intensive care episodes needing a central venous or arterial catheter vary from around 88,000 to 226,000 depending on whether episodes longer than 48 hours, or all episodes, are used. Based on these estimates, if the use of Tegaderm CHG became standard practice, it has the potential to save the NHS in England between \u00a34.2 million and \u00a310.8 million each year, assuming the baseline catheter-related bloodstream infection rate is 1.48 per 1000 catheter days.subhead:Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System for placing peripherally inserted central cathetersThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters.The case for adopting the Sherlock 3CG TCS for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters is supported by the evidence. The technology usually avoids the need for a confirmatory chest X-ray in patients who would otherwise have blind insertion, minimising the delay before the catheter can be used for infusion. Using the technology increases staff confidence during catheter insertion.The Sherlock 3CG TCS should be considered as an option for placement of peripherally inserted central catheters in adults. For patients whose electrocardiogram does not show a P wave (for example, patients with atrial fibrillation), a chest X-ray will still be needed to confirm tip location of the peripherally inserted central catheter.The cost of using the Sherlock 3CG TCS is similar to that of blind insertion and subsequent chest X-ray in adults who need a peripherally inserted central catheter in a non-intensive care setting. When the Sherlock 3CG TCS is used instead of fluoroscopy, the estimated cost saving is \u00a3106 per patient. In an intensive care setting, where the rate of misplacement with blind insertion is generally higher, there is an estimated cost saving of \u00a341 per patient per use of the Sherlock 3CG TCS and a confirmatory chest X-ray compared with using blind insertion and chest X-ray. All these cost savings are subject to some uncertainty and need to be considered in the context of the clinical benefits.subhead:Medtech innovation briefingsNICE has published medtech innovation briefings on: Biopatch for venous or arterial catheter sites AccuVein AV400 for vein visualisation.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
