Ensure that service users understand the main side-effect profiles of the medications recommended for rapid tranquillisation (see rapid tranquillisation), so that they can make an informed choice.Ensure that carers are involved in decision-making whenever possible, if the service user agrees, and that carers are involved in decision-making for all service users who lack mental capacity, in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

This could include: secondary care medical specialists such as psychiatrists, geriatricians and neurologists  other healthcare professionals such as GPs, nurse consultants and advanced nurse practitioners with specialist expertise in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer s disease.  Ensure that local arrangements for prescribing, supply and treatment review follow what NICE says on medicines optimisation.The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease.1. The three acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are recommended as options for managing mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease under all of the conditions specified above and in paragraph 4 below.2. Memantine is recommended as an option for managing Alzheimer s disease for people with: moderate Alzheimer s disease who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE inhibitors or severe Alzheimer s disease.Treatment should be under the conditions specified above.3. Treatment should be continued only when it is considered to be having a worthwhile effect on cognitive, global, functional or behavioural symptoms.4. If prescribing an AChE inhibitor (donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine), treatment should normally be started with the drug with the lowest acquisition cost (taking into account required daily dose and the price per dose once shared care has started). However, an alternative AChE inhibitor could be prescribed if it is considered appropriate when taking into account adverse event profile, expectations about adherence, medical comorbidity, possibility of drug interactions and dosing profiles.5. When using assessment scales to determine the severity of Alzheimer s disease, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect the results and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. Healthcare professionals should also be mindful of the need to secure equality of access to treatment for patients from different ethnic groups, in particular those from different cultural backgrounds.6. When assessing the severity of Alzheimer s disease and the need for treatment, healthcare professionals should not rely solely on cognition scores in circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to do so. These include: if the cognition score is not, or is not by itself, a clinically appropriate tool for assessing the severity of that patient s dementia because of the patient s learning difficulties or other disabilities (for example, sensory impairments), linguistic or other communication difficulties or level of education or if it is not possible to apply the tool in a language in which the patient is sufficiently fluent for it to be appropriate for assessing the severity of dementia or if there are other similar reasons why using a cognition score, or the score alone, would be inappropriate for assessing the severity of dementia.In such cases healthcare professionals should determine the need for initiation or continuation of treatment by using another appropriate method of assessment.

Do not make negative assumptions based on culture, religion or ethnicity.  Recognise that unfamiliar cultural practices and customs could be misinterpreted as being aggressive.  Ensure that the risk assessment will be objective and take into account the degree to which the perceived risk can be verified.Carry out the risk assessment with the service user and, if they agree, their carer. If this finds that the service user could become violent or aggressive, set out approaches that address: service user-related domains in the framework (see framework and policies for anticipating and reducing violence and aggression) contexts in which violence and aggression tend to occur usual manifestations and factors likely to be associated with the development of violence and aggression  primary prevention strategies that focus on improving quality of life and meeting the service user s needs symptoms or feelings that may lead to violence and aggression, such as anxiety, agitation, disappointment, jealousy and anger, and secondary prevention strategies focusing on these symptoms or feelings de-escalation techniques that have worked effectively in the past restrictive interventions that have worked effectively in the past, when they are most likely to be necessary and how potential harm or discomfort can be minimised.Consider using an actuarial prediction instrument such as the BVC (Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist) or the DASA-IV (Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression \u2013 Inpatient Version), rather than unstructured clinical judgement alone, to monitor and reduce incidents of violence and aggression and to help develop a risk management plan in inpatient psychiatric settings.Consider offering service users with a history of violence or aggression psychological help to develop greater self-control and techniques for self-soothing.Regularly review risk assessments and risk management plans, addressing the service user and environmental domains listed in and following the recommendations\u00a0in framework and policies for anticipating and reducing violence and aggression. The regularity of the review should depend on the assessment of the level of risk. Base the care plan on accurate and thorough risk assessments.If service users are transferring to another agency or care setting, or being discharged, share the content of the risk assessment with staff in the relevant agencies or care settings, and with carers.subhead:Community and primary care settingsHealth and social care provider organisations, including ambulance trusts, should ensure that staff working in community and primary care settings are able to undertake a risk assessment for violence and aggression in collaboration with service users known to be at risk and their carers if possible. The risk assessment should be available for case supervision and in community teams it should be subject to multidisciplinary review.After a risk assessment has been carried out, staff working in community and primary care settings should: share the risk assessment with other health and social care services and partner agencies (including the police and probation service) who may be involved in the person s care and treatment, and with carers if there are risks to them be aware of professional responsibilities in relation to limits of confidentiality and the need to share information about risks. In community settings, carry out Mental Health Act 1983 assessments with a minimum of 2 people, for example a doctor and a social worker.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

At least once during each shift a nurse should set aside dedicated time to assess the mental state of, and engage positively with, the service user. As part of the assessment, the nurse should evaluate the impact of the service user s mental state on the risk of violence and aggression, and record any risk in the notes.subhead:Observation policyHealth and social care provider organisations should have a policy on observation and positive engagement that includes: definitions of levels of observation (see below) who can instigate, increase, decrease and review observation when an observer should be male or female how often reviews should take place how service users  experience of observation will be taken into account how to ensure that observation is underpinned by continuous attempts to engage therapeutically the levels of observation necessary during the use of other restrictive interventions (for example, seclusion) the need for multidisciplinary review when observation continues for 1\u00a0week or more.subhead:Levels of observationStaff in psychiatric inpatient wards (including general adult wards, older adult wards, psychiatric intensive care units and forensic wards) should use the following definitions for levels of observation, unless a locally agreed policy states otherwise. Low-level intermittent observation: the baseline level of observation in a specified psychiatric setting. The frequency of observation is once every 30\u201360\u00a0minutes. High-level intermittent observation: usually used if a service user is at risk of becoming violent or aggressive but does not represent an immediate risk. The frequency of observation is once every 15\u201330\u00a0minutes.  Continuous observation: usually used when a service user presents an immediate threat and needs to be kept within eyesight or at arm s length of a designated one-to-one nurse, with immediate access to other members of staff if needed. Multiprofessional continuous observation: usually used when a service user is at the highest risk of harming themselves or others and needs to be kept within eyesight of 2 or 3 staff members and at arm s length of at least 1 staff member.subhead:Using observationUse observation only after positive engagement with the service user has failed to dissipate the risk of violence and aggression.Recognise that service users sometimes find observation provocative, and that it can lead to feelings of isolation and dehumanisation. Use the least intrusive level of observation necessary, balancing the service user s safety, dignity and privacy with the need to maintain the safety of those around them. Give the service user information about why they are under observation, the aims of observation, how long it is likely to last and what needs to be achieved for it to be stopped. If the service user agrees, tell their carer about the aims and level of observation. Record decisions about observation levels in the service user s notes and clearly specify the reasons for the observation.When deciding on levels of observation take into account: the service user s current mental state any prescribed and non-prescribed medications and their effects the current assessment of risk the views of the service user, as far as possible.Record clearly the names and titles of the staff responsible for carrying out a review of observation levels (see above) and when the review should take place.Staff undertaking observation should: take an active role in engaging positively with the service user be appropriately briefed about the service user s history, background, specific risk factors and particular needs be familiar with the ward, the ward policy for emergency procedures and potential risks in the environment be approachable, listen to the service user and be able to convey to the service user that they are valued.Ensure that an individual staff member does not undertake a continuous period of observation above the general level for longer than 2\u00a0hours. If observation is needed for longer than 2\u00a0hours, ensure the staff member has regular breaks. When handing over to another staff member during a period of observation, include the service user in any discussions during the handover if possible.Tell the service user s psychiatrist or on-call doctor as soon as possible if observation above the general level is carried out (see above).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If continuing treatment is necessary, make arrangements for a smooth transition to adult services and give information to the young person about the treatment and services they may need. The timing of transition may vary locally and individually but should usually be completed by the time the young person is 18 years. Variations should be agreed by both child and adult services.As part of the preparation for the transition to adult services, health and social care professionals should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the young person with autism. The assessment should make best use of existing documentation about personal, educational, occupational, social and communication functioning, and should include assessment of any coexisting conditions, especially depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD and global delay or intellectual disability in line with comprehensive assessment.For young people aged 16 or older whose needs are complex or severe, use the CPA in England, or care and treatment plans in Wales, as an aid to transfer between services. Involve the young person in the planning and, where appropriate, their parents or carers. Provide information about adult services to the young person, including their right to a social care assessment at age 18. During transition to adult services, consider a formal meeting involving health and social care and other relevant professionals from child and adult services.For more information, see NICE s recommendations on transition from children s to adults  services.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Consider physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. Ensure people with dementia have the same access to palliative care services as others. Primary care teams should assess the palliative care needs of people close to death. Communicate the result within the team and to other health and social care staff. Encourage people with dementia to eat and drink by mouth for as long as possible. Specialist assessment and advice about swallowing and feeding should be available. Dietary advice may be useful. Do not generally use tube feeding in severe dementia if dysphagia or disinclination to eat is a manifestation of disease severity. Consider nutritional support, including tube feeding, if dysphagia is thought to be transient. Apply ethical and legal principles to decisions to withhold or withdraw nutritional support. Clinically assess fever in severe dementia (especially in the terminal stages). Treatment with simple analgesics, antipyretics and mechanical cooling may suffice. Consider palliative use of antibiotics after an individual assessment.subhead:ResuscitationInstitutional policies should reflect the fact that cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to succeed in people with severe dementia. If the person with dementia has not made an advance decision to refuse resuscitation: take into account any expressed wishes of the person with dementia and the views of the carers and the multidisciplinary team follow the Resuscitation Council UK s guidance follow the Mental Capacity Act 2005 if the person lacks capacity record decisions in the notes and care plan.subhead:Pain reliefIf there are unexplained changes in behaviour or signs of distress, assess for undetected pain, using an observational pain assessment tool if helpful.
