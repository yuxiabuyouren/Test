Ensure all people with MS have a comprehensive review of all aspects of their care at least once a year.Ensure the comprehensive review is carried out by healthcare professionals with expertise in MS and its complications. Involve different healthcare professionals with expertise in specific areas of the review if needed.  Tailor the comprehensive review to the needs of the person with MS assessing: MS symptoms: mobility and balance including falls need for mobility aids including wheelchair assessment use of arms and hands  muscle spasms and stiffness tremor  bladder, bowel and sexual function sensory symptoms and pain speech and swallowing vision cognitive symptoms fatigue  depression and anxiety sleep respiratory function.For further information, see NICE S recommendations on preventing falls in older people, urinary incontinence in neurological disease, faecal incontinence, neuropathic pain,  nutrition support in adults, depression and generalised anxiety disorder. MS disease course: relapses in last year. General health: weight smoking, alcohol and recreational drugs exercise access to routine health screening and contraception care of other chronic conditions.For further information, see NICE s recommendations on obesity, smoking, alcohol-use disorders, drug misuse management in over 16s and physical activity. Social activity and participation: family and social circumstances driving and access to transport employment access to daily activities and leisure. Care and carers: personal care needs social care needs access to adaptations and equipment at home.Refer any issues identified during the comprehensive review of the person with MS to members of the MS multidisciplinary team and other appropriate teams so that they can be managed. Ensure people with MS are offered a medication review in line with NICE s recommendations on medicines optimisation.Ensure people with MS have their bone health regularly assessed and reviewed in line with NICE s recommendations on osteoporosis.Ensure people with MS and severely reduced mobility are regularly assessed and reviewed for risk of contractures.Check people with MS and severely reduced mobility at every contact for areas at risk of pressure ulcers (see NICE s recommendations on pressure ulcers).Discuss the care provided by carers and care workers as part of the person s care plan. Ensure carers know about their right to a local authority carer s assessment and how to apply for one.  Refer people with MS to palliative care services for symptom control and for end of life care when appropriate.

Ensure follow-up is included in the guidance and pathway. Non-specialists should discuss a person s diagnosis of relapse and whether to offer steroids with a healthcare professional with an expertise in MS because not all relapses need treating with steroids. subhead:Treating a relapseAssess and offer treatment for relapses of MS, that affect the person s ability to perform their usual tasks, as early as possible and within 14 days of onset of symptoms. Offer treatment for relapse of MS with oral methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days. Consider intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days as an alternative for people with MS:  in whom oral steroids have failed or not been tolerated or who need admitting to hospital for a severe relapse or monitoring of medical or psychological conditions such as diabetes or depression.Do not prescribe steroids at lower doses than methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days to treat an acute relapse of MS.Do not give people with MS a supply of steroids to self-administer at home for future relapses.subhead:Information about treating a relapse with steroidsDiscuss the benefits and risks of steroids with the person with MS, taking into account the effect of the relapse on the person s ability to perform their usual tasks and their wellbeing.Explain the potential complications of high-dose steroids, for example temporary effects on mental health (such as depression, confusion and agitation) and worsening of blood glucose control in people with diabetes.Give the person with MS and their family members or carers (as appropriate) information that they can take away about side effects of high-dose steroids in a format that is appropriate for them.  Ensure that the MS multidisciplinary team is told that the person is having a relapse, because relapse frequency may influence which disease-modifying therapies are chosen and whether they need to be changed.subhead:Medical, therapy and social care needs at time of relapse or exacerbationIdentify whether the person having a relapse of MS or their family members or carers have social care needs and if so refer them to social services for assessment. Offer inpatient treatment to the person having a relapse of MS if their relapse is severe or if it is difficult to meet their medical and social care needs at home.Explain that a relapse of MS may have short-term effects on cognitive function. Identify whether the person with MS having a relapse or exacerbation needs additional symptom management or rehabilitation.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.5Managing relapsesSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
