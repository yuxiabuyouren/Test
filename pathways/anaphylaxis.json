The ImmunoCAP ISAC\u00a0112 shows promise and further research is recommended on the clinical effectiveness of using it in people with allergy that is difficult to diagnose (see the section\u00a0on recommendations for further research of NICE diagnostics guidance 24). Microtest is a new technology and further research by the company to show its clinical effectiveness is encouraged.An allergy healthcare professional with appropriate expertise is needed to ensure the results of multiplex allergen tests are interpreted correctly.subhead:ManagementPharmalgen for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergyThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on  pharmalgen for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy.Pharmalgen is recommended as an option for the treatment of IgE-mediated bee and wasp venom allergy in people who have had: a severe systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom, or a moderate systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom and who have one or more of the following: a raised baseline serum tryptase, a high risk of future stings or anxiety about future stings.Treatment with Pharmalgen should be initiated and monitored in a specialist centre experienced in venom immunotherapy.
