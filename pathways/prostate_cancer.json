patients with suspected lung cancer, because they are associated with faster diagnosis and less patient anxiety.All cancer units/centres should have one or more trained lung cancer clinical nurse specialists to see patients before and after diagnosis, to provide continuing support, and to facilitate communication between the secondary care team (including the MDT), the patient s GP, the community team and the patient. Their role includes helping patients to access advice and support whenever they need it.Every cancer network should have a system of rapid access to PET-CT scanning for eligible patients.Every cancer network should have at least one centre with EBUS and/or EUS to ensure timely access.Every cancer network should ensure that patients have rapid access to a team capable of providing interventional endobronchial treatments. The local test performance of non-ultrasound-guided TBNA, EBUS and EUS-guided FNA should be the subject of audit.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Public awareness4Lung cancer clinical nurse specialist6Investigations15Palliative interventionsSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Include in your discussion: prognosis of their cancer and advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options, including best supportive care.Consider percutaneous nephrostomy or retrograde stenting (if technically feasible) for people with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer and ureteric obstruction who need treatment to relieve pain, treat acute kidney injury or improve renal function before further treatment.If facilities for percutaneous nephrostomy or retrograde stenting are not available at the local hospital, or if these procedures are unsuccessful, discuss the options with a specialist urology multidisciplinary team for people with bladder cancer and ureteric obstruction.Memokath-051 stent for ureteric obstructionThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on Memokath-051 stent for ureteric obstruction.The case for adopting Memokath-051 for treating ureteric obstruction is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence is limited but suggests that in selected cases, Memokath-051 is effective at relieving ureteric obstruction and improving quality of life. When inserted by trained clinicians (see section 4.8) and in appropriate patients (see below), Memokath-051 is associated with equivalent success rates and a better patient experience compared with double-J stents. Using Memokath-051 may also reduce the number of stent replacements needed compared with using double-J stents.Memokath-051 stents should be considered as an option in patients with: malignant ureteric obstruction and anticipated medium- or long-term survival after adjunctive therapy benign ureteric obstruction who cannot have or do not want reconstructive surgery or ureteric obstruction of any kind who cannot have or do not want a double-J stent, or for whom repeat procedures are a particularly high risk.The cost consequences of adopting Memokath-051 are uncertain. However, when used in appropriate patients and by clinicians trained in its use, it may be cost neutral or cost saving compared with standard treatment. Potential cost savings mainly come from fewer repeat procedures with Memokath-051.subhead:Intractable bleedingEvaluate the cause of intractable bleeding with the local urology team.Consider hypofractionated radiotherapy or embolisation for people with intractable bleeding caused by incurable bladder cancer.If a person has intractable bleeding caused by bladder cancer, and radiotherapy or embolisation are not suitable treatments, discuss further management with a specialist urology multidisciplinary team.subhead:Pelvic painEvaluate the cause of pelvic pain with the local urology team.Consider, in addition to best supportive care, 1 or more of the following to treat pelvic pain caused by incurable bladder cancer: hypofractionated radiotherapy if the person has not had pelvic radiotherapy nerve block palliative chemotherapy.See NICE s recommendations on metastatic spinal cord compression.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

NICE looked at SonoVue when it is used with ultrasound to look at the liver. It can give doctors more information about abnormal-looking areas in the liver than normal ultrasound, which can help with the diagnosis.NICE has said that SonoVue is recommended for use with ultrasound for examining abnormal-looking areas in the liver that are noticed, but cannot be properly identified, using normal ultrasound. These areas may have been noticed during routine scanning. If they were noticed when looking for cancer that has spread from another part of the body, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want a CT (computed tomography) scan.

The evidence is limited but suggests that in selected cases, Memokath-051 is effective at relieving ureteric obstruction and improving quality of life. When inserted by trained clinicians (see section 4.8) and in appropriate patients (see below), Memokath-051 is associated with equivalent success rates and a better patient experience compared with double-J stents. Using Memokath-051 may also reduce the number of stent replacements needed compared with using double-J stents.Memokath-051 stents should be considered as an option in patients with: malignant ureteric obstruction and anticipated medium- or long-term survival after adjunctive therapy benign ureteric obstruction who cannot have or do not want reconstructive surgery or ureteric obstruction of any kind who cannot have or do not want a double-J stent, or for whom repeat procedures are a particularly high risk.The cost consequences of adopting Memokath-051 are uncertain. However, when used in appropriate patients and by clinicians trained in its use, it may be cost neutral or cost saving compared with standard treatment.

Radium-223 dichlorideThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on radium-223 dichloride for treating hormone-relapsed prostate cancer with bone metastases.Radium-223 dichloride is recommended as an option for treating hormone-relapsed prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases in adults, only if: they have already had docetaxel or docetaxel is contraindicated or is not suitable for them.The drug is only recommended if the company provides radium-223 dichloride with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.This guidance is not intended to affect the position of patients whose treatment with radium-223 dichloride was started within the NHS before this guidance was published. Treatment of those patients may continue without change to whatever funding arrangements were in place for them before this guidance was published until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on radium-223 dichloride.DenosumabThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in adults with bone metastases from solid tumours.Denosumab is not recommended for preventing skeletal-related events in adults with bone metastases from prostate cancer.Adults with bone metastases from solid tumours currently receiving denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events that is not recommended according to the criteria above should be able to continue treatment until they and their clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on denosumab.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay.  The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.subhead: Depth of anaesthesia  monitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on depth of anaesthesia monitors \u2013 Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M. The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.For further information, see what NICE says on preoperative tests.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance: cryotherapy for malignant endobronchial obstruction  photodynamic therapy for advanced bronchial carcinoma.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.8Curative treatment in people of borderline fitnessSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical.  Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be: planned within a time frame agreed with the person or patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
