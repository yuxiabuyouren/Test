For people with suspected sepsis take blood cultures before antibiotics are given. If meningococcal disease is specifically suspected (fever and purpuric rash) give appropriate doses of parenteral benzyl penicillin in community settings and intravenous ceftriaxone in hospital settings. For all people with suspected sepsis where the source of infection is clear use existing local antimicrobial guidance.For people aged 18 years and over who need an empirical intravenous antimicrobial for a suspected infection but who have no confirmed diagnosis, use an intravenous antimicrobial from the agreed local formulary and in line with local (where available) or national guidelines. For people aged up to 17 years (except neonates) with suspected community acquired sepsis of any cause give ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once a day with a maximum dose of 4g daily at any age. For people aged up to 17 years with suspected sepsis who are already in hospital, or who are known to have previously been infected with or colonised with ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria, consult local guidelines for choice of antibiotic.Follow NICE s recommendations on antimicrobial stewardship when prescribing and using antibiotics to treat people with suspected or confirmed sepsis.subhead:Diagnostic testingThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on procalcitonin testing for diagnosing and monitoring sepsis.The procalcitonin tests (ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay, BRAHMS PCT Sensitive Kryptor assay, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT assay and VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay) show promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption in the NHS. Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).The following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on tests for rapidly identifying bloodstream bacteria and fungi (LightCycler SeptiFast Test MGRADE, SepsiTest and IRIDICA BAC BSI assay).There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the routine adoption in the NHS of the LightCycler SeptiFast Test MGRADE, SepsiTest and IRIDICA BAC BSI assay for rapidly identifying bloodstream bacteria and fungi. The tests show promise and further research to provide robust evidence is encouraged, particularly to demonstrate the value of using the test results in clinical decision-making (see sections 5.18 to 5.22 of NICE diagnostics guidance 20).NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on Fungitell for antifungal treatment stratification.subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend. Do not use starch-based solutions or hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation for people with sepsis.Consider human albumin solution 4\u20135% for fluid resuscitation only in patients with sepsis and shock.If patients over 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 500 ml over less than 15 minutes. If children and young people up to 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130\u2013154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes. Take into account pre-existing conditions (for example, cardiac disease or kidney disease), because smaller fluid volumes may be needed.If using a pump or flow controller to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to people over 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form ensure device is capable of delivering fluid at required rate for example at least 2000 ml/hour in adults. subhead:OxygenGive oxygen to achieve a target saturation of 94\u201398% for adult patients or 88\u201392% for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure.Oxygen should be given to children with suspected sepsis who have signs of shock or oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 92% when breathing air.

For people with suspected sepsis take blood cultures before antibiotics are given. If meningococcal disease is specifically suspected (fever and purpuric rash) give appropriate doses of parenteral benzyl penicillin in community settings and intravenous ceftriaxone in hospital settings. For all people with suspected sepsis where the source of infection is clear use existing local antimicrobial guidance.For people aged up to 17 years (except neonates) with suspected community acquired sepsis of any cause give ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once a day with a maximum dose of 4g daily at any age. For people aged up to 17 years with suspected sepsis who are already in hospital, or who are known to have previously been infected with or colonised with ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria, consult local guidelines for choice of antibiotic.For children younger than 3 months, give an additional antibiotic active against listeria (for example, ampicillin or amoxicillin).

If 40 weeks corrected gestational age or below or receiving an intravenous calcium infusion use cefotaxime 50 mg/kg every 6 to 12 hours, depending on the age of the neonate.Follow NICE s recommendations on antimicrobial stewardship when prescribing and using antibiotics to treat people with suspected or confirmed sepsis.Diagnostic testingThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on procalcitonin testing for diagnosing and monitoring sepsis.The procalcitonin tests (ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay, BRAHMS PCT Sensitive Kryptor assay, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT assay and VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay) show promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine adoption in the NHS. Further research on procalcitonin tests is recommended for guiding decisions to: stop antibiotic treatment in people with confirmed or highly suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit or start and stop antibiotic treatment in people with suspected bacterial infection presenting to the emergency department.Centres currently using procalcitonin tests to guide these decisions are encouraged to participate in research and data collection (see section 6.25 of NICE diagnostics guidance 18).subhead:FluidsReassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus.

This should include taking the correct dose for the time specified and via the correct route.
