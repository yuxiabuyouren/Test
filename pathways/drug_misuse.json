Take advice from substance misuse services (if applicable) about these interventions. (See NICE s recommendations on coexisting severe mental illness and substance misuse: assessment and management in healthcare settings, psychosis and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, self-harm, alcohol-use disorders and drug misuse management in over 16s.)Offer individual, face-to-face or phone appointment sessions to encourage people with coexisting severe mental illness and substance misuse to use services. Offer phone sessions to their family or carers. Sessions could cover: how the person is coping with their current mental health and substance use and its impact on their physical health and social care needs  progress on current goals or changes to future goals ways to help the person stay safe monitoring symptoms getting support from (and for) their family, carers or providers. Determine how often the sessions take place based on the person s needs.

This may include them providing training, developing interventions to help people or taking part in steering committees. Provide local services in places that are easily accessible, safe and discreet. Bear in mind any perceived stigma involved in being seen to use the service. Consider flexible opening times, drop-in sessions, or meeting people in their preferred locations. Ensure people with coexisting severe mental illness and substance misuse, their family or carers are given accurate information about relevant local services (including, for example, community or family support groups).

If both drugs are equally suitable, methadone should be prescribed as the first choice.Methadone and buprenorphine should be administered daily, under supervision, for at least the first 3 months. Supervision should be relaxed only when the patient s compliance is assured. Both drugs should be given as part of a programme of supportive care. NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on methadone and buprenorphine.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Examples of other settings and approaches that could be used include: custody centres, sexual health services, outreach and detached services. Provide a mix of the following levels of service to meet local needs:  Level 1: distribution of injecting equipment either loose or in packs, suitable for different types of injecting practice, with written information on harm reduction. (For example, telling people about specialist agencies, or giving them details about safer injecting practices, including how to prevent an overdose.) Level 2: distribution of  pick and mix  (bespoke) injecting equipment and referral to specialist services plus health promotion advice. (This includes advice and information on how to reduce the harms caused by injecting drugs.) Some level 2 services might also offer additional services, such as blood-borne virus testing or vaccination. Level 3: level 2 plus provision of, or referral to, other specialist services (for example, specialist clinics, vaccinations, drug treatment and secondary care). See specialist (level 3) programmes. Establish links and referral pathways between the different levels of service to promote integration and to share learning and expertise. Coordinate services to ensure testing for hepatitis B and C and other blood-borne viruses is readily available to everyone who uses a needle and syringe programme (see NICE s recommendations on hepatitis B and C testing for further information). Coordinate services to ensure injecting equipment is available at times, and in places, that meet the needs of people who inject drugs. For example, it may be appropriate to provide out-of-hours vending machines for groups that would not otherwise have access to services \u2013 or not at the time that they need them. (The location of these machines would need to be considered carefully and their use would need to be regularly monitored.)  Another example would be to encourage pharmacies with longer opening hours to provide needles, syringes and other injecting equipment. Ensure services offering opioid substitution therapy also make needles and syringes available to their service users, in line with the National Treatment Agency s Models of care for treatment of adult drug misusers: update 2006.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Needle and syringe programmesSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
