Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay.

The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitorThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitor.The case for adopting the CardioQ-ODM in the NHS, when used as described below, is supported by the evidence.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Image reportingSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This shows that the Ambu aScope2 is an acceptable alternative, where a multiple-use fibre optic endoscope is unavailable. There are also advantages during replacement of dislodged tracheostomy tubes in the intensive care setting. Making the Ambu aScope2 available for use across settings is likely to improve outcomes and patient safety.Adoption of the Ambu aScope2 is supported by cost modelling for a range of common clinical settings in which there is no multiple-use endoscope or where existing multiple-use endoscopes are not available. These settings are: isolated units, operating theatre units, and intensive care units, where the uses include the repositioning of displaced tracheostomy tubes. Although there were some uncertainties in the cost modelling, cost savings are likely in all settings modelled. The amount saved will depend on the number of intubations performed and on the number (if any) of existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes in use.The details of the cost modelling and estimated cost savings for each clinical setting are described in sections 5.16-5.20 of the guidance. As an example of the clinical area where savings could be greatest, using the Ambu aScope2 in the intensive care setting is estimated to be cost saving (\u00a33128 per year) when more than 700 intubations are conducted each year, when there are 2 or fewer existing multiple-use fibre optic endoscopes, and assuming that 5% of intubations are difficult.subhead:Translaryngeal tracheostomyNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on translaryngeal tracheostomy with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Airway managementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
