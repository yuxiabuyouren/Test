Specialist physiotherapists should assess and advise people with cystic fibrosis at clinic, at inpatient admissions, during pulmonary exacerbations and at their annual review on. Assessment and advice should cover airway clearance, nebuliser use, musculoskeletal disorders, exercise, physical activity and urinary incontinence.Specialist dietitians should assess and advise people with cystic fibrosis about all aspects of nutrition at outpatient clinic visits, during inpatient admissions and at their annual review (see nutrition). Specialist pharmacists should advise people with cystic fibrosis on medicines optimisation at outpatient clinic visits, during inpatient admissions, on discharge from hospital and at annual review. They should advise healthcare professionals on all aspects of medicines use and prescribing, and support GPs, community pharmacists and homecare providers to ensure that people with cystic fibrosis get the medicines they need without interruption. See NICE s recommendations on medicines optimisation.Specialist clinical psychologists should assess and advise people with cystic fibrosis and their family members or carers (as appropriate) at outpatient clinic visits and (if needed) at other outpatient appointments, during inpatient admissions, and at their annual review (see psychological assessment). The specialist cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary team should either include or have access to specialist expertise relevant to cystic fibrosis in the following areas: microbiology pulmonary physiology diabetes gastroenterology hepatology rheumatology psychiatry interventional radiology surgery (gastrointestinal, thoracic, and ear, nose and throat) obstetrics palliative care.The specialist cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary team should work with the person s GP, providing timely information so that the GP is able to support the person with cystic fibrosis by:  prescribing cystic fibrosis medicines: in batches of at least 1 month at a time for routine medicines  for longer periods if advised by the specialist team following guidance on arrangements for prescriptions of unlicensed medicines providing routine annual immunisation, including any alterations for people with cystic fibrosis and flu vaccinations for family members and carers managing health problems not related to cystic fibrosis  certification of illnesses working in partnership with cystic fibrosis homecare teams, particularly for end of life care providing care for the person s family members or carers.
