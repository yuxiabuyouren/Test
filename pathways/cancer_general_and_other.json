cancer, because they are associated with faster diagnosis and less patient anxiety.All cancer units/centres should have one or more trained lung cancer clinical nurse specialists to see patients before and after diagnosis, to provide continuing support, and to facilitate communication between the secondary care team (including the MDT), the patient s GP, the community team and the patient. Their role includes helping patients to access advice and support whenever they need it.Every cancer network should have a system of rapid access to PET-CT scanning for eligible patients.Every cancer network should have at least one centre with EBUS and/or EUS to ensure timely access.Every cancer network should ensure that patients have rapid access to a team capable of providing interventional endobronchial treatments.

Offer smoking cessation support to all people with bladder cancer who smoke, in line with NICE s guidelines on smoking cessation services and brief interventions and referral for smoking cessation (see NICE s recommendations on stopping smoking in everyone). Offer people with bladder cancer and, if they wish, their partners, families or carers, opportunities to have discussions at any stage during their treatment and care with: a range of specialist healthcare professionals, including those who can provide psychological support other people with bladder cancer who have had similar treatments.Clinicians caring for people with bladder cancer should ensure that there is close liaison between secondary and primary care with respect to ongoing and community-based support. Trusts should consider conducting annual bladder cancer patient satisfaction surveys developed by their urology multidisciplinary team and people with bladder cancer, and use the results to guide a programme of quality improvement.For further information, see NICE s recommendations on medicines optimisation.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.3Access to a clinical nurse specialistSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Clinicians should bear in mind that people with disabilities may have difficulties with activities of daily living that are unrelated to their prognosis for malignant glioma. For such people clinicians should make appropriate judgements about performance status, taking into account the person s usual functional capacity and need for assistance with activities of daily living.People whose treatment with temozolomide is not recommended in this NICE guidance, but was started within the NHS before this guidance was published, should be able to continue treatment until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.For guidance on carmustine implants and temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade glioma see newly diagnosed high-grade glioma.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on temozolomide.subhead:Photodynamic therapyNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on photodynamic therapy for brain tumours, which should be used only in the context of a formal research protocol.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Reassure people in the safety netting group (see referral and safety netting) who are concerned that they may have cancer that with their current symptoms their risk of having cancer is low.  Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see referral and safety netting) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist.

This practical resource is for primary care professionals (it is not formal NICE guidance).The recommendations in this guidance on diagnostic investigations refer to people whose condition is being managed in secondary care. Advise the patient that more than one investigation may be necessary to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Offer colonoscopy to patients without major comorbidity, to confirm a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected, perform a biopsy to obtain histological proof of diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated (for example, patients with a blood clotting disorder). Offer flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema for patients with major comorbidity. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected perform a biopsy unless it is contraindicated. Consider computed tomographic (CT) colonography as an alternative to colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema, if the local radiology service can demonstrate competency in this technique. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected on CT colonography, offer a colonoscopy with biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated.

Do not wait for the results before starting treatment.If using immunohistochemistry, follow the steps in table 1.Table 1 Steps in the immunohistochemistry testing strategyStep 1 Do an immunohistochemistry 4-panel test for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Step 2 If the MLH1 immunohistochemistry result is abnormal, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test.  If the MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 immunohistochemistry results are abnormal, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  If using microsatellite instability testing, follow the steps in table 2.Table 2 Steps in the microsatellite instability testing strategyStep 1 Do a microsatellite instability test. Step 2 If the microsatellite instability test result is positive, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  Healthcare professionals should ensure that people are informed of the possible implications of test results for both themselves and their relatives, and ensure that relevant support and information is available. Discussion of genetic testing should be done by a healthcare professional with appropriate training.Laboratories doing microsatellite instability testing or immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins should take part in a recognised external quality assurance programme.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1ColonoscopySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.

It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action.
