An eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 should trigger investigation into whether anaemia is due to CKD. When the eGFR is greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m2 the anaemia is more likely to be related to other causes. Carry out testing to diagnose iron deficiency and determine potential responsiveness to iron therapy and long-term iron requirements every 3 months (every 1\u20133 months for people receiving haemodialysis) (see diagnostic tests to determine iron status and predict response to iron therapy). Use percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (%HRC; more than 6%), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 hours. If using %HRC is not possible, use reticulocyte haemoglobin content (less than 29 pg) or equivalent tests \u2013 for example, reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent. If these tests are not available or the person has thalassaemia or thalassaemia trait, use a combination of transferrin saturation (less than 20%) and serum ferritin measurement (less than 100 micrograms/litre).Do not request transferrin saturation or serum ferritin measurement alone to assess iron deficiency status in people with anaemia of CKD.

The evidence is limited but suggests that in selected cases, Memokath-051 is effective at relieving ureteric obstruction and improving quality of life. When inserted by trained clinicians (see section 4.8) and in appropriate patients (see below), Memokath-051 is associated with equivalent success rates and a better patient experience compared with double-J stents. Using Memokath-051 may also reduce the number of stent replacements needed compared with using double-J stents.Memokath-051 stents should be considered as an option in patients with: malignant ureteric obstruction and anticipated medium- or long-term survival after adjunctive therapy benign ureteric obstruction who cannot have or do not want reconstructive surgery or ureteric obstruction of any kind who cannot have or do not want a double-J stent, or for whom repeat procedures are a particularly high risk.The cost consequences of adopting Memokath-051 are uncertain. However, when used in appropriate patients and by clinicians trained in its use, it may be cost neutral or cost saving compared with standard treatment.

The recommendations apply only to the initial immunosuppressive therapy (induction and maintenance therapy) started around the time of kidney transplant.It was outside the scope of the appraisal to make recommendations on using azathioprine or corticosteroids after kidney transplant in children and young people.Under an exceptional directive from the Department of Health, the appraisal committee was allowed to make recommendations about using drugs outside the terms of their marketing authorisations if there was compelling evidence of their safety and effectiveness.Basiliximab, when used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen that includes a calcineurin inhibitor, is recommended as an initial option to prevent organ rejection in children and young people having a kidney transplant.August 2017: the use of basiliximab (with tacrolimus) and mycophenolate mofetil (with tacrolimus) is outside the terms of the marketing authorisations for basiliximab and for mycophenolate mofetil. If these combinations are prescribed, the prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. For further information, see the General Medical Council s guidance on Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices.,The Department of Health has stated that the statutory funding requirement does not apply to drugs that are used outside the terms of their marketing authorisation. Immediate-release tacrolimus, when used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen, is recommended as an initial option to prevent organ rejection in children and young people having a kidney transplant. Treatment should normally be started with the least expensive product.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised that to maintain therapeutic response when a patient is stabilised on a particular brand, oral tacrolimus products should be prescribed and dispensed by brand name only. If a prescriber considers that switching to a different brand of oral tacrolimus would be of benefit, the change requires careful supervision and therapeutic monitoring by an appropriate specialist. See the MHRA s advice on oral tacrolimus products. However, treatment can be started with an alternative dosage form if the least expensive product is not suitable (for example, if the child or young person is not able to swallow capsules or they are unable to have a particular ingredient because of allergy or religious reasons). Tacrolimus granules for oral suspension (Modigraf) should be used only if the company provides it at the same price or lower than that agreed with the Commercial Medicines Unit.Mycophenolate mofetil, when used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen, is recommended as an initial option to prevent organ rejection in children and young people having a kidney transplant. Treatment should normally be started with the least expensive product. However, treatment can be started with an alternative dosage form if the least expensive product is not suitable (for example, if the child or young person is not able to swallow capsules or they are unable to have a particular ingredient because of allergy or religious reasons)., Rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin, prolonged-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate sodium, sirolimus, everolimus and belatacept are not recommended as initial treatments to prevent organ rejection in children and young people having a kidney transplant.The committee was unable to make recommendations on any of the technologies considered in this appraisal as options for preventing organ rejection in children or young people who are, or become, unable to have the technologies recommended above or azathioprine and corticosteroids (for example, because of treatment failure, contraindications, or intolerance such as nephrotoxicity associated with calcineurin inhibitors, or thrombotic microangiopathy). This includes children and young people who: are unable to continue having their initial therapy and need to switch to another therapy during the life of their graft or have a second or subsequent transplant, having previously found that 1 or more of the recommended initial treatments or standard treatments are clinically unsuitable, for example because of treatment failure, contraindications or intolerance.These recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with any of the technologies in this appraisal that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. Children and young people having treatment outside these recommendations, or for whom the committee were unable to make a recommendation, may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.

Repeat these measurements between 1 and 2 weeks after starting renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists and after each dose increase.Do not routinely offer a renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonist to people with CKD if their pretreatment serum potassium concentration is greater than 5.0 mmol/litre.When hyperkalaemia precludes use of renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists, assessment, investigation and treatment of other factors known to promote hyperkalaemia should be undertaken and the serum potassium concentration rechecked.Concurrent prescription of drugs known to promote hyperkalaemia is not a contraindication to the use of renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists, but be aware that more frequent monitoring of serum potassium concentration may be required.Stop renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists if the serum potassium concentration increases to 6.0 mmol/litre or more and other drugs known to promote hyperkalaemia have been discontinued.Following the introduction or dose increase of renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists, do not modify the dose if either the GFR decrease from pretreatment baseline is less than 25% or the serum creatinine increase from baseline is less than 30%. If there is a decrease in eGFR or increase in serum creatinine after starting or increasing the dose of renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonists, but it is less than 25% (eGFR) or 30% (serum creatinine) of baseline, repeat the test in 1\u20132 weeks. Do not modify the renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonist dose if the change in eGFR is less than 25% or the change in serum creatinine is less than 30%.If the eGFR change is 25% or more, or the change in serum creatinine is 30% or more:  investigate other causes of a deterioration in renal function, such as volume depletion or concurrent medication (for example, NSAIDs)  if no other cause for the deterioration in renal function is found, stop the renin\u2013angiotensin system antagonist or reduce the dose to a previously tolerated lower dose, and add an alternative antihypertensive medication if required.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Chronic kidney disease in adults2Blood pressure controlSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These recommendations are applicable only to those patients who, after detailed assessment of all their treatment options, have been defined as being suitable for haemodialysis.It is recommended that all suitable patients should be offered the choice between home haemodialysis or haemodialysis in a hospital/satellite unit.In general, patients suitable for home haemodialysis will be those who: have the ability and motivation to learn to carry out the process and the commitment to maintain treatment are stable on dialysis are free of complications and significant concomitant disease that would render home haemodialysis unsuitable or unsafe have good functioning vascular access have a carer who has (or carers who have) also made an informed decision to assist with the haemodialysis unless the individual is able to manage on his or her own have suitable space and facilities or an area that could be adapted within their home environment.A full assessment of the patient s clinical needs, social circumstances and home environment is necessary to determine his or her suitability for home haemodialysis. In order to make an informed choice about the location of haemodialysis that is most suitable for their particular circumstances, patients and all potential carers should be fully informed regarding what is involved in the different options, and the potential impact on their lives and those of their households should be discussed. All potential carer(s) should be given the opportunity to express their views independently of the patient. An opportunity to review the decision to proceed or continue with home haemodialysis should be available in the event of any change in circumstances.Patients currently treated in hospital who are potentially suitable for home haemodialysis on clinical grounds, but who have not previously been offered a choice, should be reassessed and informed about their dialysis options.Patients performing haemodialysis at home and their carers will require initial training and an accessible and responsive support service.

To keep the Hb level within the aspirational range, do not wait until Hb levels are outside the aspirational range before adjusting treatment (for example, take action when Hb levels are within 5 g/litre of the range s limits).Consider accepting Hb levels below the agreed aspirational range if: high dosesMore than 175 international units per kg per week for haemodialysis population; more than 125 international units per kg per week for peritoneal dialysis population; more than 100 international units per kg per week for non-dialysis population.
