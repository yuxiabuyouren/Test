If continuing treatment is necessary, make arrangements for a smooth transition to adult services and give information to the young person about the treatment and services they may need. The timing of transition may vary locally and individually but should usually be completed by the time the young person is 18 years. Variations should be agreed by both child and adult services.As part of the preparation for the transition to adult services, health and social care professionals should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the young person with autism. The assessment should make best use of existing documentation about personal, educational, occupational, social and communication functioning, and should include assessment of any coexisting conditions, especially depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD and global delay or intellectual disability in line with comprehensive assessment.For young people aged 16 or older whose needs are complex or severe, use the CPA in England, or care and treatment plans in Wales, as an aid to transfer between services. Involve the young person in the planning and, where appropriate, their parents or carers. Provide information about adult services to the young person, including their right to a social care assessment at age 18. During transition to adult services, consider a formal meeting involving health and social care and other relevant professionals from child and adult services.For more information, see NICE s recommendations on transition from children s to adults  services.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
