Ranibizumab, within its marketing authorisation, is recommended as an option for the treatment of wet AMD if: all of the following circumstances apply in the eye to be treated: the best-corrected visual acuity is between 6/12 and 6/96 there is no permanent structural damage to the central fovea the lesion size is less than or equal to 12 disc areas in greatest linear dimension there is evidence of recent presumed disease progression (blood vessel growth, as indicated by fluorescein angiography, or recent visual acuity changes)and the manufacturer provides ranibizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme (as revised in 2012).It is recommended that treatment with ranibizumab should be continued only in people who maintain adequate response to therapy. Criteria for discontinuation should include persistent deterioration in visual acuity and identification of anatomical changes in the retina that indicate inadequate response to therapy. It is recommended that a national protocol specifying criteria for discontinuation is developed.Pegaptanib is not recommended for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.People who are currently receiving pegaptanib for any lesion type should have the option to continue therapy until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public on ranibizumab and pegaptanib.subhead:Photodynamic therapyDo not offer PDT alone for late AMD (wet active).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
