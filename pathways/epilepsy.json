Consideration should be given to developmental age, gender, culture and stage of life of the person.Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to educate others about epilepsy so as to reduce the stigma associated with it. Provide information about epilepsy to all people who come into contact with children, young people and adults with epilepsy, including school staff, social care professionals and others. subhead:Information to provideGive to the person and their families and/or carers, and ensure access to sources of, information about (where appropriate):  epilepsy in general diagnosis and treatment options (see also diagnosis and treatment in this pathway) medication and side effects (see also anti-epileptic drugs in this pathway) seizure type(s), triggers and seizure control management and self-care risk management first aid, safety and injury prevention at home and at school or work psychological issues social security benefits and social services insurance issues education and healthcare at school employment and independent living for adults importance of disclosing epilepsy at work, if relevant (if further information or clarification is needed, voluntary organisations should be contacted) road safety and driving prognosis sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP; see below) status epilepticus (see also status epilepticus in this pathway) lifestyle, leisure and social issues (including recreational drugs, alcohol, sexual activity and sleep deprivation) family planning and pregnancy (see also special considerations for women and girls with epilepsy in this pathway) voluntary organisations, such as support groups and charitable organisations, and how to contact them.subhead:When to give information about epilepsyThe time at which this information should be given will depend on the certainty of the diagnosis, and the need for confirmatory investigations.Give appropriate information before important decisions are made (for example, regarding pregnancy or employment).Discuss the possibility of having seizures, and provide information on epilepsy before seizures occur, for those at high risk of developing seizures (such as after severe brain injury), with a learning disability, or who have a strong family history of epilepsy. For more information on people with learning disabilities, see people with learning disabilities in this pathway.Set aside adequate time in the consultation to provide information \u2013 revisit in subsequent consultations.Use checklists to remind children, young people and adults, and healthcare professionals, about information that should be discussed during consultations.Ensure that the child, young person or adult with epilepsy and their family and/or carers as appropriate knows how to contact a named individual when information is needed. This named individual should be a member of the healthcare team and be responsible for ensuring that the information needs of the child, young person or adult and/or their family and/or carers are met.If children, young people and adults, and families and/or carers, have not already found high-quality information from voluntary organisations and other sources, inform them of different sources (using the Internet, if appropriate: see, for example, the website of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland).subhead:Providing information about sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)Include information on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in literature on epilepsy to show why preventing seizures is important. Include tailored information on the person s relative risk of SUDEP as part of the counselling checklist.The risk of SUDEP can be minimised by:  optimising seizure control being aware of the potential consequences of nocturnal seizures. Take account of the small but definite risk of SUDEP when tailoring information and discussions. Where families and/or carers have been affected by SUDEP, contact them to offer condolences, invite them to discuss the death, and offer referral to bereavement counselling and a SUDEP support group.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.4Epilepsy care plan (children and young people)4Epilepsy care plan (adults)SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
