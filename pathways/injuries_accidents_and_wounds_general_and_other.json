Involve them in decision-making to the fullest extent possible depending on their age and developmental stage.Use a range of methods (for example, drawing, books or activities if appropriate) for communicating with children and young people. Tailor communication to: their age and developmental stage any disabilities, for example learning difficulties, neurodevelopmental disorders and hearing and visual impairments, seeking assistance from specialists if needed communication needs, for example by using communication aids or providing an interpreter (ensure the interpreter is not a family member).In all conversations with children and young people where there are concerns about child abuse and neglect: explain confidentiality and when you might need to share specific information, and with whom be sensitive and empathetic listen actively and use open questions  find out their views and wishes  check your understanding of what the child has told you be sensitive to any religious or cultural beliefs use plain language and explain any technical terms work at the child or young person s pace give them opportunities to stop the conversation or leave the room, and follow up if this does happen explain what will happen next and when.Make sure that conversations take place somewhere private and where the child or young person feels comfortable. Take account of any sensory issues the child or young person may have.If your interaction with a child or young person involves touching them (for example, a medical examination) explain what you are going to do and ask for consent: from them if they are over 16 (follow the Mental Capacity Act 2005) or under 16 but Gillick competent or from their parent or carer if they are under 16 and not Gillick competent.If the child, young person or parent does not agree, respect their wishes unless touching them is essential to their treatment (seek legal advice first unless the need for treatment is immediate). For more guidance on seeking consent for medical examination in children and young people see the General Medical Council s 0-18 years: guidance for all doctors.Produce a record of conversations with children and young people about abuse and neglect, and any subsequent interventions as appropriate to their age, developmental stage and language abilities. This could be in writing or another format suitable to meet the child or young person s communication needs. Ensure that you: Accurately represent their words, using their actual words unless there is a good reason not to, for example if this would include information about another child or young person. Check that they have understood and agree with what is recorded (this could include both of you signing a written record) and record any disagreements. Share reports and plans with the child or young person in a way that is appropriate to their age and understanding.Clearly explain how you will work together with children and young people and do what you have said you will do. If circumstances change and this is no longer possible, explain why as soon as possible, and offer alternative actions.Agree with the child or young person (if age appropriate) how you will communicate with each other. Give them contact details, including for services available out of hours. When contacting them:  be aware of safety issues such as whether a perpetrator of abuse may have access to a young person s phone agree what will happen if you contact them and they do not respond, for example following up with their nominated emergency contact.NICE has written information for the public on child abuse and neglect.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Alerting features are symptoms and signs that may indicate that child abuse or neglect is taking place, and which should prompt practitioners to take action.In this guidance we use  consider  and  suspect  to indicate the extent to which an alerting feature suggests child abuse and neglect, with  suspect  indicating stronger evidence of child abuse and neglect.If a child is in immediate danger, refer to children s social care and/or the police. Otherwise, in response to any of the alerting features in this guidance, please follow the steps below in line with the Department for Education s Working together to safeguard children.For all alerting features: Seek advice from named or designated colleagues or your organisation s safeguarding lead.  Speak to the child or young person as detailed in communicating with children and young people, if this is age and developmentally appropriate and it is safe to do so.For recommendations starting with  suspect : Discuss the need for a referral with children s social care using local multi-agency safeguarding procedures.For recommendations starting with  consider : Look for other alerting features in the child or young person s history, presentation or interactions with their parents or carers, now or in the past.  Gather information from other agencies and explain to the family that this information is needed to make an overall assessment of the child or young person. If this is likely to place the child or young person at risk, seek advice from children s social care. Make sure a review of the child or young person takes place, with the timing depending on your level of concern. Continue to look out for the alerting feature being repeated, or for any other alerting features.After taking these steps, if your level of concern increases to  suspect , discuss the need for a referral with children s social care. If you conclude that a referral to children s social care is not required, you may wish to undertake or make a referral for early help assessment in line with local procedures.As highlighted in this guidance, alerting features for child abuse and neglect can be similar to behaviours arising from other causes, such as other stressful life experiences or neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. However, practitioners should continue to consider the possibility of child abuse or neglect as a cause for behavioural and emotional alerting features, even if they are seemingly explained by another cause. Practitioners should also recognise that alerting features may be due to non-recent child abuse or neglect. If the alerting features relate to past child abuse or neglect, but the child or young person is now in a place of safety (for example, in an adoptive family), assess the child or young person to see what support they and their parent, carer, foster carer or adoptive parent need to cope with the consequences of the child abuse or neglect.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Spectra Optia is faster to use and needs to be done less often than manual red blood cell exchange. Spectra Optia should be considered for automated red blood cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease who need regular transfusion. NICE recommends collaborative data collection to generate further clinical evidence on some outcomes of treatment with Spectra Optia. In particular, there is a need for long-term data on how automated and manual exchange affect iron overload status and the subsequent need for chelation therapy.Based on current evidence and expert advice on the anticipated benefits of the technology when used in patients with iron overload, cost modelling shows that in most cases using Spectra Optia is cost saving compared with manual red blood cell exchange or top-up transfusion. The savings depend on the iron overload status of the patient, and are more likely to be achieved if devices already owned by the NHS can be used to treat sickle cell disease. The estimated cost saving for adopting Spectra Optia is \u00a318,100 per patient per year, which has the potential to save the NHS in England \u00a312.9 million each year.

One trial showed that an unsupervised brisk walking programme increased the risk of falling in postmenopausal women with an upper limb fracture in the previous year. However, there may be other health benefits of brisk walking by older people. subhead:Interventions that cannot be recommended because of insufficient evidenceWe do not recommend implementation of the following interventions at present. This is not because there is strong evidence against them, but because there is insufficient or conflicting evidence supporting them.Low intensity exercise combined with continence programmesThere is no evidence that low intensity exercise interventions combined with continence promotion programmes reduce the incidence of falls in older people in extended care settings.Group exercise (untargeted)Exercise in groups should not be discouraged as a means of health promotion, but there is little evidence that exercise interventions that were not individually prescribed for older people living in the community are effective in falls prevention.Cognitive behavioural interventionsThere is no evidence that cognitive/behavioural interventions alone reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community who are of unknown risk status. Such interventions included risk assessment with feedback and counselling and individual education discussions. There is no evidence that complex interventions in which group activities included education, a behaviour modification programme aimed at moderating risk, advice and exercise interventions are effective in falls prevention with older people living in the community.Referral for correction of visual impairmentThere is no evidence that referral for correction of vision as a single intervention for older people living in the community is effective in reducing the number of people falling. However, vision assessment and referral has been a component of successful multifactorial falls prevention programmes.Vitamin DThere is evidence that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common among older people and that, when present, they impair muscle strength and possibly neuromuscular function, via CNS-mediated pathways. In addition, the use of combined calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation has been found to reduce fracture rates in older people in residential/nursing homes and sheltered accommodation. Although there is emerging evidence that correction of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may reduce the propensity for falling, there is uncertainty about the relative contribution to fracture reduction via this mechanism (as opposed to bone mass) and about the dose and route of administration required. No firm recommendation can therefore currently be made on its use for this indication.For further information, see NICE s recommendations on vitamin D: supplement use in specific population groups.Hip protectorsReported trials that have used individual patient randomisation have provided no evidence for the effectiveness of hip protectors to prevent fractures when offered to older people living in extended care settings or in their own homes. Data from cluster randomised trials provide some evidence that hip protectors are effective in the prevention of hip fractures in older people living in extended care settings who are considered at high risk.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
