The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitorThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitor.The case for adopting the CardioQ-ODM in the NHS, when used as described below, is supported by the evidence. There is a reduction in post-operative complications, use of central venous catheters and in-hospital stay (with no increase in the rate of re-admission or repeat surgery) compared with conventional clinical assessment with or without invasive cardiovascular monitoring. The cost saving per patient, when the CardioQ-ODM is used instead of a central venous catheter in the peri-operative period, is about \u00a31,100 based on a 7.5-day hospital stay.The CardioQ-ODM should be considered for use in patients undergoing major or high-risk surgery or other surgical patients in whom a clinician would consider using invasive cardiovascular monitoring.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Offer total hip replacement rather than hemiarthroplasty to patients with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture who: were able to walk independently out of doors with no more than the use of a stick and are not cognitively impaired and are medically fit for anaesthesia and the procedure.Use a proven femoral stem design rather than Austin Moore or Thompson stems for arthroplasties. Suitable designs include those with an Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel rating of 10A, 10B, 10C, 7A, 7B, 5A, 5B, 3A or 3B.Use cemented implants in patients undergoing surgery with arthroplastyThe Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, British Orthopaedic Association and British Geriatric Society have produced a safety guideline on reducing the risk from cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture (2015). This safety guideline is not NICE accredited..Consider an anterolateral approach in favour of a posterior approach when inserting a hemiarthroplasty.Use extramedullary implants such as a sliding hip screw in preference to an intramedullary nail in patients with trochanteric fractures above and including the lesser trochanter (AO classification types A1 and A2).Use an intramedullary nail to treat patients with a subtrochanteric fracture.See what NICE says on preventing and treating surgical site infections in relation to the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections.
