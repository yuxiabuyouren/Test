Consider social norms, family practices and any fears people may have about the safety of areas where physical activities take place (this includes fears about how safe it is to travel there and back).Map physical activity opportunities against local needs and address any gaps in provision.Ensure commissioned leisure services are affordable and acceptable to those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This means providing affordable childcare facilities. It also means public transport links should be affordable and the environment should be culturally acceptable. For example, local authorities should consider the appropriateness of any videos and music played. They should also consider providing single-gender facilities, exercise classes, swimming sessions and walking groups \u2013 for both men and women. Provide information on local, affordable, practical and culturally acceptable opportunities to be more active. If cultural issues affect people s ability to participate, work with them to identify activities which may be acceptable. (This may include, for example, single-gender exercise and dance classes, or swimming sessions with same-gender lifeguards.) Encourage local employers to develop policies to encourage employees to be more physically active, for example, by using healthier modes of transport to and from work.

The retailers targeted may include regional and national supermarkets and convenience store chains, as well as street markets and small independent shops.Encourage local caterers to include details in menus on the calorie content of meals to help consumers make an informed choice. If the nutritional value of recipes is not known, they should consider listing ingredients and describing the cooking methods used.Ensure local authorities and NHS organisations develop internal policies to help prevent employees from being overweight or obese. Encourage local employers to develop similar policies. This is in line with existing NICE guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy. For example, organisations could promote healthier food and drink choices in staff restaurants, hospitality suites, vending machines and shops by using posters, pricing and the positioning of products.

Interventions should take into account the religious beliefs, cultural practices, age and gender, language and literacy of black, minority ethnic and lower socioeconomic groups. (Interventions costing up to \u00a310 per head would need to achieve an average weight loss of about 0.25 kg per head to be cost effective. Those costing up to \u00a3100 per head would need to achieve an average weight loss of about 1 kg per head.)Identify success criteria in the early stages of development to ensure interventions can be properly evaluated. Identify any skills gaps and train or recruit staff to fill the gaps.Identify and address barriers to participation. This includes developing communication strategies that are sensitive to the target audience s language and information requirements.Identify local resources and existing community groups that could help promote healthy eating, physical activity and weight management, particularly within local communities at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Use community resources to improve awareness of the key messages and to increase accessibility to the interventions. For example, involve community organisations and leaders at the development stage and use media, plan events or attend festivals specifically aimed at black and minority ethnic communities and lower socioeconomic groups. Also involve existing community and social groups or clubs, such as toddler groups, pubs, social clubs and local sports clubs. Where they exist, use community links, outreach projects and lay or peer workers (from black and minority ethnic communities and from lower socioeconomic groups) to deliver interventions.Where necessary, train lay and peer workers in how to plan, design and deliver community-based health promotion activities. Training should be based on proven training models and evaluation techniques. It should give participants the chance to practice their new skills in the community. It should also encourage them to pass on their knowledge to their peers.Lay and peer workers and health professionals should identify and encourage community champions (for example, religious and community leaders) to promote healthy eating and physical activity.Encourage lay and peer workers to get other members of their community involved.Ensure lay and peer workers are part of a wider team led by health professionals. They should be involved in the planning, design and delivery of credible and culturally appropriate messages. This includes helping people to develop the practical skills they need to adopt a healthier lifestyle. For example, they should be able to run nutrition education sessions (theory and practice) or physical activity sessions. Management and supervision of these activities should be provided by the health professionals leading these teams.Commission culturally appropriate and financially accessible weight management programmes either from the NHS or non-NHS providers, based on the guiding principles for effective weight-loss programmes. These should be provided in community settings in areas where populations at high risk of type 2 diabetes live. (For example, they could be provided in religious venues or community and social clubs.)Ensure the systems or initiatives used to assess someone from a high-risk community are culturally appropriate.Ensure identification and assessment systems or initiatives are linked to effective services and interventions for individuals deemed to be at high risk.See group and individual-level interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes among people at high risk.Align actions to prevent type 2 diabetes with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see what NICE says on obesity: working with local communities).See what NICE says on community engagement.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

First, a risk assessment should be offered (see below). Second, where necessary, a blood test should be offered to confirm whether people have type 2 diabetes or are at high risk (see offer a blood test). Service providers including pharmacists, managers of local health and community services and voluntary organisations, employers and leaders of faith groups should offer validated self-assessment questionnaires or validated web-based tools (for examples, see the Diabetes UK website). They should also provide the information needed to complete and interpret them. The tools should be available in local health, community and social care venues. Examples of possible health venues include: community pharmacies, dental surgeries, NHS walk-in centres and opticians. Examples of community and social care venues include: workplaces, job centres, local authority leisure services, shops, libraries, faith centres, residential and respite care homes and day centres (for older adults and for adults with learning disabilities). Public health, primary care and community services should publicise local opportunities for risk assessment and the benefits of preventing (or delaying the onset of) type 2 diabetes. The information should be up-to-date and provided in a variety of formats. It should also be tailored for different groups and communities. For example, by offering translation services and information in languages used locally. Where risk assessment is conducted by health professionals in NHS venues outside general practice (for example, in community pharmacies) the professionals involved should ensure the results are passed on to the person s GP. GPs should keep records of all risk assessment results to ensure appropriate follow-up and continuity of care. Where self-assessment is offered in community venues, health professionals and community practitioners in those venues should encourage people with an intermediate or high risk score to visit their GP to discuss how to manage their risk. Those at high risk should be offered a blood test by their GP.Ensure health professionals and community practitioners involved with risk assessments in community venues communicate closely with, and receive support from, NHS diabetes risk-assessment and prevention services. They should aim to ensure continuity of care and avoid unnecessary duplication of risk assessments. Managers in primary and secondary healthcare should ensure staff actively seek out and offer risk assessments to people who might not realise they could be at high risk.

Throughout the course of an inpatient admission, respect the personal expertise of adults with type 1 diabetes (in managing their own diabetes) and routinely integrate this into ward-based blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery. Throughout the course of an inpatient admission, the personal knowledge and needs of adults with type 1 diabetes regarding their dietary requirements should be a major determinant of the food choices offered to them, except when illness or medical or surgical intervention significantly disturbs those requirements. Members of care teams caring for adults with type 1 diabetes in institutions, such as nursing homes, residential homes and prisons, should follow these recommendations. Provide optimal insulin therapy, which can be achieved by the use of intravenous insulin and glucose, to all adults with type 1 diabetes with threatened or actual stroke.

Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set.The Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system shows promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to support its routine adoption in the NHS for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes. Robust evidence is needed to show the clinical effectiveness of using the technology in practice.People with type 1 diabetes who are currently provided with the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system or the Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system by the NHS for clinical indications that are not recommended in this NICE guidance should be able to continue using them until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.Medtech innovation briefingsNICE has produced medtech innovation briefings on: FreeStyle Libre for glucose monitoring MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.4Continuous glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetesSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

For the purpose of this guidance, disabling hypoglycaemia is defined as the repeated and unpredictable occurrence of hypoglycaemia that results in persistent anxiety about recurrence and is associated with a significant adverse effect on quality of life or HbA1c levels have remained high (that is, at 8.5% [69 mmol/mol] or above) on MDI therapy (including, if appropriate, the use of long-acting insulin analogues) despite a high level of care.It is recommended that CSII therapy be initiated only by a trained specialist team, which should normally comprise a physician with a specialist interest in insulin pump therapy, a diabetes specialist nurse and a dietitian. Specialist teams should provide structured education programmes and advice on diet, lifestyle and exercise appropriate for people using CSII.Following initiation in adults and children 12 years and older, CSII therapy should only be continued if it results in a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, evidenced by a fall in HbA1c levels, or a sustained decrease in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes. Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set by the responsible physician, in discussion with the person receiving the treatment or their carer.NICE has written information for the public on insulin pump therapy.subhead:Rapid-acting insulinOffer rapid-acting insulin analogues injected before meals, rather than rapid-acting soluble human or animal insulins, for mealtime insulin replacement for adults with type 1 diabetes.Do not advise routine use of rapid-acting insulin analogues after meals for adults with type 1 diabetes.

Multiple daily injection basal\u2013bolus insulin regimens: injections of short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue before meals, together with 1 or more separate daily injections of intermediate-acting insulin or long-acting insulin analogue.Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump therapy): a programmable pump and insulin storage device that gives a regular or continuous amount of insulin (usually a rapid-acting insulin analogue or short-acting insulin) by a subcutaneous needle or cannula.One, two or three insulin injections per day: these are usually injections of short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue mixed with intermediate-acting insulin. Take into account the personal and family circumstances of the child or young person with type 1 diabetes and discuss their personal preferences with them and their family members or carers (as appropriate) when choosing an insulin regimen.Offer children and young people with type 1 diabetes multiple daily injection basal\u2013bolus insulin regimens from diagnosis. If a multiple daily injection regimen is not appropriate for a child or young person with type 1 diabetes, consider continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy (see below).Encourage children and young people with type 1 diabetes who are using multiple daily insulin injection regimens and their family members or carers (as appropriate) to adjust the insulin dose if appropriate after each blood glucose measurement.Explain to children and young people with type 1 diabetes using multiple daily insulin injection regimens and their family members or carers (as appropriate) that injecting rapid-acting insulin analogues before eating (rather than after eating) reduces blood glucose levels after meals and helps to optimise blood glucose control.Provide all children and young people with type 1 diabetes who are starting continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy and their family members or carers (as appropriate) with specific training in its use. Provide ongoing support from a specialist team, particularly in the period immediately after starting continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Specialist teams should agree a common core of advice for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion users.Encourage children and young people with type 1 diabetes who are using twice-daily injection regimens and their family members or carers (as appropriate) to adjust the insulin dose according to the general trend in pre-meal, bedtime and occasional night-time blood glucose.Explain to children and young people with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and their family members or carers (as appropriate) that they may experience a partial remission phase (a  honeymoon period ) during which a low dosage of insulin (0.5 units/kg body weight/day) may be sufficient to maintain an HbA1c level of less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%).Offer children and young people with type 1 diabetes a choice of insulin delivery systems that takes account of their insulin requirements and personal preferences.Provide children and young people with type 1 diabetes with insulin injection needles that are of an appropriate length for their body fat.Provide children and young people with type 1 diabetes and their family members or carers (as appropriate) with suitable containers for collecting used needles and other sharps. Arrangements should be available for the suitable disposal of these containers. See what NICE says on safe use and disposal of sharps for prevention and control of healthcare-associated infectionsOffer children and young people with type 1 diabetes a review of injection sites at each clinic visit.Provide children and young people with type 1 diabetes with rapid-acting insulin analogues for use during intercurrent illness or episodes of hyperglycaemia.If a child or young person with type 1 diabetes does not have optimal blood glucose control (see blood glucose targets and monitoring and HbA1c targets and monitoring):  offer appropriate additional support such as increased contact frequency with their diabetes team, and  if necessary, offer an alternative insulin regimen (multiple daily injections, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII or insulin pump] therapy or once-, twice- or three-times daily mixed insulin injections).subhead:Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusionThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or  insulin pump ) therapy is recommended as a treatment option for adults and children 12 years and older with type 1 diabetes mellitus provided that: attempts to achieve target haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels with multiple daily injections (MDIs) result in the person experiencing disabling hypoglycaemia. For the purpose of this guidance, disabling hypoglycaemia is defined as the repeated and unpredictable occurrence of hypoglycaemia that results in persistent anxiety about recurrence and is associated with a significant adverse effect on quality of lifeor HbA1c levels have remained high (that is, at 8.5% [69 mmol/mol] or above) on MDI therapy (including, if appropriate, the use of long-acting insulin analogues) despite a high level of care.CSII therapy is recommended as a treatment option for children younger than 12 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus provided that: MDI therapy is considered to be impractical or inappropriate, and children on insulin pumps would be expected to undergo a trial of MDI therapy between the ages of 12 and 18 years.It is recommended that CSII therapy be initiated only by a trained specialist team, which should normally comprise a physician with a specialist interest in insulin pump therapy, a diabetes specialist nurse and a dietitian. Specialist teams should provide structured education programmes and advice on diet, lifestyle and exercise appropriate for people using CSII.Following initiation in adults and children 12 years and older, CSII therapy should only be continued if it results in a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, evidenced by a fall in HbA1c levels, or a sustained decrease in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes. Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set by the responsible physician, in discussion with the person receiving the treatment or their carer.NICE has written information for the public on insulin pump therapy.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.3Intensive insulin therapy and level 3 carbohydrate-counting education for type 1 diabetesSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These are lower than standard fluid maintenance volumes because large fluid volumes are associated with an increased risk of cerebral oedema.Aim to replace the fluid deficit evenly over the first 48 hours in children and young people with DKA, because faster rehydration is associated with an increased risk of cerebral oedema.Use 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose for both rehydration and maintenance fluid in children and young people with DKA until the plasma glucose concentration is below 14 mmol/litre.Ensure that all fluids (except any initial bolus) administered to children and young people with DKA contain 40 mmol/litre potassium chloride, unless they have renal failure.If more than 20 ml/kg of fluid has been given by intravenous bolus to a child or young person with DKA, subtract any additional bolus volumes from the total fluid calculation for the 48-hour period.Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to children and young people with DKA.Think about inserting a urinary catheter if it is not possible to accurately measure urine output for a child or young person with DKA.Do not give children and young people with DKA additional intravenous fluid to replace urinary losses.Start an intravenous insulin infusion 1\u20132 hours after beginning intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people with DKA.When treating DKA with intravenous insulin in children and young people, use a soluble insulin infusion at a dosage between 0.05 and 0.1 units/kg/hour. Do not give bolus doses of intravenous insulin.If a child or young person with DKA is using insulin pump therapy, disconnect the pump when starting intravenous insulin therapy.In discussion with a diabetes specialist, think about continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before the onset of DKA.Change fluids to 0.9% sodium chloride with 5% glucose and 40 mmol/litre potassium chloride once the plasma glucose concentration falls below 14 mmol/litre in children and young people with DKA.If during treatment for DKA a child or young person s plasma glucose falls below 6 mmol/litre: increase the glucose concentration of the intravenous fluid infusion, and if there is persisting ketosis, continue to give insulin at a dosage of least 0.05 units/kg/hour.If the blood beta-hydroxybutyrate level is not falling within 6\u20138 hours in a child or young person with DKA, think about increasing the insulin dosage to 0.1 units/kg/hour or greater.Think about stopping intravenous fluid therapy for DKA in a child or young person if ketosis is resolving, they are alert, and they can take oral fluids without nausea or vomiting.Do not change from intravenous insulin to subcutaneous insulin in a child or young person with DKA until ketosis is resolving, they are alert, and they can take oral fluids without nausea or vomiting.Start subcutaneous insulin in a child or young person with DKA at least 30 minutes before stopping intravenous insulin.For a child or young person with DKA who is using insulin pump therapy, restart the pump at least 60 minutes before stopping intravenous insulin. Change the insulin cartridge and infusion set, and insert the cannula into a new subcutaneous site.See what NICE says on intravenous fluid therapy in hospital.

Encourage high-fibre, low-glycaemic-index sources of carbohydrate in the diet, such as fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses; include low-fat dairy products and oily fish; and control the intake of foods containing saturated and trans fatty acids.Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight.For adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight, set an initial body weight loss target of 5\u201310%. Remember that lesser degrees of weight loss may still be of benefit, and that larger degrees of weight loss in the longer term will have advantageous metabolic impact.Individualise recommendations for carbohydrate and alcohol intake, and meal patterns. Reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia should be a particular aim for a person using insulin or an insulin secretagogue.Advise adults with type 2 diabetes that limited substitution of sucrose-containing foods for other carbohydrate in the meal plan is allowable, but that they should take care to avoid excess energy intake.Discourage the use of foods marketed specifically for people with diabetes.When adults with type 2 diabetes are admitted to hospital as inpatients or to any other care setting, implement a meal planning system that provides consistency in the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.For recommendations on lifestyle advice, see what NICE says on diet, lifestyle weight management services for overweight or obese adults, obesity, physical activity and smoking.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Structured education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetesSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Makes it clear that risk-assessment services and intensive lifestyle-change programmes should be delivered by trained practitioners (see training to carry out diabetes risk assessments and interventions). Health and wellbeing boards and public health commissioners, working with clinical commissioning groups, should integrate the commissioning plan with the joint health and wellbeing strategy. They should ensure it is delivered through services operating across the NHS, local authorities and other organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors. Health and wellbeing boards and public health commissioners should regularly evaluate services in the context of these recommendations and changing local needs. They should use local accountability mechanisms (for example, health scrutiny reports) to examine specific issues. Health and wellbeing boards and public health commissioners should evaluate or compare the different service options and make the findings publicly available.

Involve the target community (including community leaders) in planning the design and delivery of the programme to ensure it is sensitive and flexible to the needs, abilities and cultural or religious norms of local people. For example, the programme should offer practical learning opportunities, particularly for those who have difficulties with communication or literacy or whose first language is not English.Ensure programmes are delivered by practitioners with relevant knowledge and skills who have received externally accredited training (see training to carry out diabetes risk assessments and interventions). Where relevant expertise is lacking, involve health professionals and specialists (such as dietitians and health psychologists) in the design and delivery of services. Ensure programmes adopt a person-centred, empathy-building approach. This includes finding ways to help participants make gradual changes by understanding their beliefs, needs and preferences. It also involves building their confidence and self-efficacy over time. Ensure programme components are delivered in a logical progression. For example: discussion of the risks and potential benefits of lifestyle change; exploration of someone s motivation to change; action planning; self-monitoring and self-regulation.Ensure groups meet at least eight times over a period of 9\u201318 months. Participants should have at least 16 hours of contact time either within a group, on a one-to-one basis or using a mixture of both approaches. Offer more intensive support at the start of the programme by delivering core sessions frequently (for example, weekly or fortnightly). Reduce the frequency of sessions over time to encourage more independent lifestyle management. Allow time between sessions for participants to make gradual changes to their lifestyle \u2013 and to reflect on and learn from their experiences. Also allow time during sessions for them to share this learning with the group. Deliver programmes in a range of venues such as workplaces, leisure, community and faith centres, and outpatient departments and clinics. Run them at different times, including during evenings and at weekends, to ensure they are as accessible as possible.As part of the programme, offer referral to, or seek advice from, people with specialist training where necessary. For example, refer someone to a dietitian for assessment and specialist dietary advice if required. Offer follow-up sessions at regular intervals (for example, every 3 months) for at least 2 years following the initial intervention period. The aim is to reinforce the positive behaviour change and to provide support, in case of relapse. Larger group sizes may be feasible for these maintenance sessions.Link the programmes with weight management and other prevention initiatives that help people to change their diet or become more physically active.subhead:ContentIntensive lifestyle-change programmes should offer ongoing tailored advice, support and encouragement to help people: undertake a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week gradually lose weight to reach and maintain a BMI within the healthy range increase their consumption of wholegrains, vegetables and other foods that are high in dietary fibre reduce the total amount of fat in their diet eat less saturated fat.Established behaviour-change techniques should be used (see what NICE says on behaviour change), including at least all of the following: Information provision: to raise awareness of the benefits of, and types of, lifestyle changes needed to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, building on what participants already know. Exploration and reinforcement of participants  reasons for wanting to change and their confidence about making changes. This may include using motivational interviewing or similar techniques suitably adapted for use in groups.  Goal-setting: prompting participants to set achievable and personally relevant short- and long-term goals (for example, to lose 5\u201310% of their weight in 1 year is a realistic initial target, or to be more physically active).  Action planning: prompting participants to produce action plans detailing what specific physical activity or eating behaviour they intend to change \u2013 and when, where and how this will happen. They should start with achievable and sustainable short-term goals and set graded tasks (starting with an easy task and gradually increasing the difficulty as they progress towards their goal). The aim is to move over time towards long-term, lifestyle change.  Coping plans and relapse prevention: prompting participants to identify and find ways to overcome barriers to making permanent changes to their exercise and eating habits. This could include the use of strategies such as impulse-control techniques (to improve management of food cravings).Participants in intensive lifestyle-change programmes should be encouraged to involve a family member, friend or carer who can offer emotional, information, planning or other practical support to help them make the necessary changes. For example, they may be able to join the participant in physical activities, help them to plan changes, make or accept changes to the family s diet or free up the participant s time so they can take part in preventive activities. (It may sometimes be appropriate to encourage the participant to get support from the whole family.)Participants should be encouraged to use self-regulation techniques. This includes self-monitoring (for example, by weighing themselves, or measuring their waist circumference or both). They should also review their progress towards achieving their goals, identify and find ways to solve problems and then revise their goals and action plans, where necessary. The aim is to encourage them to learn from experience.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

For example, they may choose to do specific activities such as walking, cycling, swimming, dancing or aerobics. Or they could build physical activity into their daily life \u2013 for example, by walking or cycling instead of using a car for short journeys, and by taking the stairs instead of the lift. Encourage people to set short and long-term goals for example, on how far they walk or cycle, or the number or length of activities undertaken every week. In addition, encourage them to keep a record of their activity for example, by using a pedometer, and to record the things that make it easier or harder.

Give fast-acting glucose (for example, 10\u201320 g) by mouth (liquid carbohydrate may be taken more easily than solid). Be aware that fast-acting glucose may need to be given in frequent small amounts, because hypoglycaemia can cause vomiting.

Control of foot infection. Control of ischaemia.  Wound debridement.  Wound dressings. Offer non-removable casting to offload plantar neuropathic, non-ischaemic, uninfected forefoot and midfoot diabetic ulcers. Offer an alternative offloading device until casting can be provided. In line with NICE s recommendations on pressure ulcers, use pressure-redistributing devices and strategies to minimise the risk of pressure ulcers developing. When treating diabetic foot ulcers, debridement in hospital should only be done by healthcare professionals from the multidisciplinary foot care service, using the technique that best matches their specialist expertise and clinical experience, the site of the diabetic foot ulcer and the person s preference. When treating diabetic foot ulcers, debridement in the community should only be done by healthcare professionals with the relevant training and skills, continuing the care described in the person s treatment plan. Consider negative pressure wound therapy after surgical debridement for diabetic foot ulcers, on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service. When deciding about wound dressings and offloading when treating diabetic foot ulcers, take into account the clinical assessment of the wound and the person s preference, and use devices and dressings with the lowest acquisition cost appropriate to the clinical circumstances. Consider dermal or skin substitutes as an adjunct to standard care when treating diabetic foot ulcers, only when healing has not progressed and on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service. Do not offer the following to treat diabetic foot ulcers, unless as part of a clinical trial: Electrical stimulation therapy, autologous platelet-rich plasma gel, regenerative wound matrices and dalteparin.

Ensure that the frequency of monitoring set out in the person s individualised treatment plan is maintained whether the person with diabetes is being treated in hospital or in the community. subhead:The Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad for use in acute or chronic wounds The following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad for use in acute or chronic wounds.The case for adopting the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad as part of the management of acute or chronic wounds in the community is supported by the evidence. The available evidence is limited, but the likely benefits of using the Debrisoft pad on appropriate wounds are that they will be fully debrided more quickly, with fewer nurse visits needed, compared with other debridement methods. In addition, the Debrisoft pad is convenient and easy to use, and is well tolerated by patients. Debridement is an important component of standard woundcare management as also described in NICE s recommendations on pressure ulcers.The Debrisoft pad is indicated for adults and children with acute or chronic wounds. The available evidence is mainly in adults with chronic wounds needing debridement in the community. The data show that the device is particularly effective for chronic sloughy wounds and hyperkeratotic skin around acute or chronic wounds. The Debrisoft pad is estimated to be cost saving for complete debridement compared with other debridement methods. When compared with hydrogel, gauze and bagged larvae, cost savings per patient (per complete debridement) are estimated to be \u00a399, \u00a3152 and \u00a3484 respectively in a community clinic and \u00a3222, \u00a3347 and \u00a3469 respectively in the home.

A lot of the evidence linking specific circulating glucose concentrations with particular outcomes uses  plasma  rather than  blood  glucose. In addition, patient-held glucose meters and monitoring systems are all calibrated to plasma glucose equivalents. However, the term  blood glucose monitoring  is in very common use, so in these recommendations we use the term  blood glucose , except when referring to specific concentration values.subhead:Blood glucose targetsAdvise adults with type 1 diabetes to aim for:  a fasting plasma glucose level of 5\u20137 mmol/litre on waking and a plasma glucose level of 4\u20137 mmol/litre before meals at other times of the day. Advise adults with type 1 diabetes who choose to test after meals to aim for a plasma glucose level of 5\u20139 mmol/litre at least 90 minutes after eating. (This timing may be different in pregnancy \u2013 for guidance on plasma glucose targets in pregnancy, see NICE s recommendations on diabetes in pregnancy.) Agree bedtime target plasma glucose levels with each adult with type 1 diabetes that take into account timing of the last meal and its related insulin dose, and are consistent with the recommended fasting level on waking. subhead:Self-monitoringAdvise routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for all adults with type 1 diabetes, and recommend testing at least 4 times a day, including before each meal and before bed. Support adults with type 1 diabetes to test at least 4 times a day, and up to 10 times a day if any of the following apply: the desired target for blood glucose control, measured by HbA1c level (see HbA1c measurement and targets), is not achieved the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes increases there is a legal requirement to do so (such as before driving, in line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency [DVLA] At a glance guide to the current medical standards of fitness to drive) during periods of illness  before, during and after sport when planning pregnancy, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding (see NICE s recommendations on diabetes in pregnancy) if there is a need to know blood glucose levels more than 4 times a day for other reasons (for example, impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, high-risk activities). Enable  additional blood glucose testing (more than 10 times a day) for adults with type 1 diabetes if this is necessary because of the person s lifestyle (for example, driving for a long period of time, undertaking high-risk activity or occupation, travel) or if the person has impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. When choosing blood glucose meters: take the needs of the adult with type 1 diabetes into account  ensure that meters meet current ISO standards. Monitoring blood glucose using sites other than the fingertips cannot be recommended as a routine alternative to conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose. For information about self-monitoring skills, see education and information.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on FreeStyle Libre for glucose monitoring.subhead:Continuous glucose monitoringDo not offer real-time continuous glucose monitoring routinely to adults with type 1 diabetes. Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 diabetes who are willing to commit to using it at least 70% of the time and to calibrate it as needed, and who have any of the following despite optimised use of insulin therapy and conventional blood glucose monitoring: More than 1 episode a year of severe hypoglycaemia with no obviously preventable precipitating cause. Complete loss of awareness of hypoglycaemia. Frequent (more than 2 episodes a week) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that is causing problems with daily activities. Extreme fear of hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemia (HbA1c level of 75 mmol/mol [9%] or higher) that persists despite testing at least 10 times a day. Continue real-time continuous glucose monitoring only if HbA1c can be sustained at or below 53 mmol/mol (7%) and/or there has been a fall in HbA1c of 27 mmol/mol (2.5%) or more. For adults with type 1 diabetes who are having real-time continuous glucose monitoring, use the principles of flexible insulin therapy with either a multiple daily injection insulin regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy.Real-time continuous glucose monitoring should be provided by a centre with expertise in its use, as part of strategies to optimise a person s HbA1c levels and reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. Integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systemsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systems for managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes (the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system and the Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system).The MiniMed Paradigm Veo system is recommended as an option for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes only if: they have episodes of disabling hypoglycaemia despite optimal management with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and the company arranges to collect, analyse and publish data on the use of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system (see section 7.1 of NICE diagnostics guidance 21).The MiniMed Paradigm Veo system should be used under the supervision of a trained multidisciplinary team who are experienced in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring for managing type 1 diabetes only if the person or their carer: agrees to use the sensors for at least 70% of the time understands how to use it and is physically able to use the system and agrees to use the system while having a structured education programme on diet and lifestyle, and counselling.People who start to use the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system should only continue to use it if they have a decrease in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes that is sustained. Appropriate targets for such improvements should be set.The Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system shows promise but there is currently insufficient evidence to support its routine adoption in the NHS for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes. Robust evidence is needed to show the clinical effectiveness of using the technology in practice.People with type 1 diabetes who are currently provided with the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system or the Vibe and G4 PLATINUM CGM system by the NHS for clinical indications that are not recommended in this NICE guidance should be able to continue using them until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard for managing blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Diabetes in pregnancy6Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels during pregnancySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

In several cases, blood glucose levels were only moderately elevated. The MHRA advised that healthcare professionals should test for raised ketones in people with ketoacidosis symptoms who are receiving an SGLT-2 inhibitor, even if their plasma glucose levels are near-normal. may be appropriate for some adults with type 2 diabetes if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated; see below.subhead:Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapiesThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapies for treating type 2 diabetes.Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapies are recommended as options for treating type 2 diabetes in adults for whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control, only if: a DPP-4 inhibitor would otherwise be prescribed and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone is not appropriate.Adults whose treatment with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin as monotherapy is not recommended in this NICE guidance, but was started within the NHS before this guidance was published, should be able to continue treatment until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Consider capillary blood ketone testing for inpatient management of DKA in adults with type 1 diabetes that is incorporated into a formal protocol. subhead:Management of DKAProfessionals managing DKA in adults should be adequately trained, including regular updating, and be familiar with all aspects of its management which are associated with mortality and morbidity. These topics should include: fluid balance acidosis cerebral oedema electrolyte imbalance disturbed interpretation of familiar diagnostic tests (white cell count, body temperature, ECG) respiratory distress syndrome cardiac abnormalities precipitating causes infection management, including opportunistic infections gastroparesis use of high dependency and intensive care units recommendations below.Management of DKA in adults should be in line with local clinical governance. For primary fluid replacement in adults with DKA, use isotonic saline, not given too rapidly except in cases of circulatory collapse. Do not generally use bicarbonate in the management of DKA in adults. Give intravenous insulin by infusion to adults with DKA. In the management of DKA in adults, once the plasma glucose concentration has fallen to 10\u201315 mmol/litre, give glucose-containing fluids (not more than 2 litres in 24 hours) in order to allow continued infusion of insulin at a sufficient rate to clear ketones (for example, 6 units/hour monitored for effect).Begin potassium replacement early in DKA in adults, with frequent monitoring for the development of hypokalaemia.Do not generally use phosphate replacement in the management of DKA in adults. In adults with DKA whose conscious level is impaired, consideration should be given to inserting a nasogastric tube, monitoring urine production using a urinary catheter and giving heparin. To reduce the risk of catastrophic outcomes in adults with DKA, ensure that monitoring is continuous and that review covers all aspects of clinical management at frequent intervals.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Use the Gold score or Clarke score to quantify awareness of hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes, checking that the questionnaire items have been answered correctly. Explain to adults with type 1 diabetes that impaired awareness of the symptoms of plasma glucose levels below 3 mmol/litre is associated with a significantly increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia. subhead:Strategies for managing impaired awareness of hypoglycaemiaEnsure that adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia have had structured education in flexible insulin therapy using basal\u2013bolus regimens and are following its principles correctly.Offer additional education focusing on avoiding and treating hypoglycaemia to adults with type 1 diabetes who continue to have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia after structured education in flexible insulin therapy.Avoid relaxing individualised blood glucose targets as a treatment for adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia.If target blood glucose levels preferred by adults with type 1 diabetes who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia are lower than recommended, reinforce the recommended targets (see blood glucose measurement and targets). Review insulin regimens and doses and prioritise strategies to avoid hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, including: reinforcing the principles of structured education offering continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy offering real-time continuous glucose monitoring. If impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia is associated with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in an adult with type 1 diabetes despite these interventions, consider referring the person to a specialist centre. subhead:Preventing and managing hypoglycaemiaExplain to adults with type 1 diabetes that a fast-acting form of glucose is needed for the management of hypoglycaemic symptoms or signs in people who are able to swallow. Adults with type 1 diabetes with a decreased level of consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia and so are unable to take oral treatment safely should be: given intramuscular glucagon by a family member or friend who has been shown how to use it (intravenous glucose may be used by healthcare professionals skilled in obtaining intravenous access) monitored for response at 10 minutes, and then given intravenous glucose if their level of consciousness is not improving significantly then given oral carbohydrate when it is safe to administer it, and placed under continued observation by a third party who has been warned of the risk of relapse. Explain to adults with type 1 diabetes that some hypoglycaemic episodes are an inevitable consequence of insulin therapy in most people using any insulin regimen, and that it is advisable that they should use a regimen that avoids or reduces the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes while maintaining as optimal a level of blood glucose control as is feasible. Make advice available to all adults with type 1 diabetes to assist in obtaining the best such balance from any insulin regimen. (See insulin therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes.) If hypoglycaemia becomes unusually problematic or of increased frequency, review the following possible contributory causes: inappropriate insulin regimens (incorrect dose distributions and insulin types) meal and activity patterns, including alcohol injection technique and skills, including insulin resuspension if necessary injection site problems possible organic causes including gastroparesis changes in insulin sensitivity (including drugs affecting the renin\u2013angiotensin system and renal failure) psychological problems previous physical activity lack of appropriate knowledge and skills for self-management. Manage nocturnal hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or detected on monitoring) by: reviewing knowledge and self-management skills reviewing current insulin regimen, evening eating habits and previous physical activity choosing an insulin type and regimen that is less likely to induce low glucose levels at night. If early cognitive decline occurs in adults on long-term insulin therapy, supplement normal investigations by the consideration or investigation of possible brain damage resulting from overt or covert hypoglycaemia, and the need to ameliorate this.
