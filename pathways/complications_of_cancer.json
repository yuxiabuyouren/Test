Supplementary axial imaging should be performed through any significant abnormality noted on the sagittal scan.Contact the MSCC coordinator to determine the most appropriate method of imaging for patients with suspected MSCC in whom MRI is contraindicated and where this should be carried out.Consider targeted CT scan with three-plane reconstruction to assess spinal stability and plan vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty or spinal surgery in patients with MSCC.Consider myelography if other imaging modalities are contraindicated or inadequate. Myelography should only be undertaken at a neuroscience or spinal surgical centre because of the technical expertise required and because patients with MSCC may deteriorate following myelography and require urgent decompression.Do not perform plain radiographs of the spine either to make or to exclude the diagnosis of spinal metastases or MSCC.If MRI is not available at the referring hospital, transfer patients with suspected MSCC to a unit with 24-hour capability for MRI and definitive treatment of MSCC.Out of hours MRI should only be performed in clinical circumstances where there is an emergency need and intention to proceed immediately to treatment, if appropriate.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2Imaging and treatment plans for adults with suspected spinal metastases3Imaging and treatment plans for adults with suspected metastatic spinal cord compressionSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
