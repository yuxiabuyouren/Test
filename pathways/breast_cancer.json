Vary advice to individual women according to the individual clinical circumstances (such as asymptomatic, age, severity of menopausal symptoms, or osteoporosis).Restrict HRT usage in a woman at familial risk to as short a duration and as low a dose as possible.  Prescribe oestrogen-only HRT where possible. Inform a woman having an early (natural or artificial) menopause of the risks and benefits of HRT, but generally confine HRT usage to women younger than age 50 years if at moderate or high risk.  Also see the recommendations on HRT after bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy before the menopause.Alternatives to HRT should be considered for specific symptoms such as osteoporosis or menopausal symptoms.Consideration should be given to the type of HRT if it is being considered for use in conjunction with risk-reducing gynaecological surgery.subhead:Hormonal contraceptivesEnsure that advice to women up to age 35 years with a family history of breast cancer is in keeping with general health advice on the use of the oral contraceptive pill.

Discuss with women with BRCA1 mutations, the conflicting effects of a potential increased risk of breast cancer under the age of 40 years and the lifetime protection against ovarian cancer risk from taking the oral contraceptive pill. Do not prescribe the oral contraceptive pill purely for prevention of cancer, although in some situations reduction in ovarian cancer risk may outweigh any increase in risk of breast cancer.

Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see referral and safety netting) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist.

Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be: planned within a time frame agreed with the person or patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Details of the development of a national registry are included in section 7 of DG8.The Metasin test is not recommended for detecting sentinel lymph node metastases in people with early invasive breast cancer in routine clinical NHS practice.
