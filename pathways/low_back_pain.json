Such research should be designed to generate robust evidence about the benefits of spinal cord stimulation (including pain relief, functional outcomes and quality of life) compared with standard care.Spinal cord stimulation should be provided only after an assessment by a multidisciplinary team experienced in chronic pain assessment and management of people with spinal cord stimulation devices, including experience in the provision of ongoing monitoring and support of the person assessed.When assessing the severity of pain and the trial of stimulation, the multidisciplinary team should be aware of the need to ensure equality of access to treatment with spinal cord stimulation. Tests to assess pain and response to spinal cord stimulation should take into account a person s disabilities (such as physical or sensory disabilities), or linguistic or other communication difficulties, and may need to be adapted.If different spinal cord stimulation systems are considered to be equally suitable for a person, the least costly should be used. Assessment of cost should take into account acquisition costs, the anticipated longevity of the system, the stimulation requirements of the person with chronic pain and the support package offered.People who are currently using spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain of ischaemic origin should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain of neuropathic or ischaemic origin.subhead:Interventional procedures guidanceNICE has published guidance on the following with standard or normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit: minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery for chronic sacroiliac pain percutaneous coblation of the intervertebral disc for low back pain and sciatica  non-rigid stabilisation techniques for the treatment of low back pain interspinous distraction procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudication  percutaneous intradiscal laser ablation in the lumbar spine.NICE has published guidance on the following with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research: percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain percutaneous electrothermal treatment of the intervertebral disc annulus for low back pain and sciatica insertion of an annular disc implant at lumbar discectomy peripheral nerve-field stimulation for chronic low back pain  automated percutaneous mechanical lumbar discectomy.NICE has published guidance that  epiduroscopic lumbar discectomy through the sacral hiatus for sciatica should only be used in the context of research.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
