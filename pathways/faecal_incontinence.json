Peristeen can reduce the severity of constipation and incontinence, improve quality of life and promote dignity and independence.Peristeen may not be suitable for all people with bowel dysfunction. It may take several weeks before a person is comfortable with using Peristeen, and some people may choose to stop using it. Peristeen is therefore most effective when it is offered with specialist training for users, carers and NHS staff, and structured patient support.Cost modelling for Peristeen is uncertain, but it is likely that Peristeen provides additional clinical benefits without costing more than standard bowel care.subhead:Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation for faecal incontinenceNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on Secca System for faecal incontinence.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Faecal incontinence in adults5Specialised managementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
