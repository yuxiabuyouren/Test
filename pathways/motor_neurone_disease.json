The neurologist should have knowledge and expertise in the following: Symptoms of motor neurone disease. Types and possible causes of motor neurone disease. Treatment options. How motor neurone disease may progress (including cognitive and behavioural changes) and how progression may affect the treatments offered.

Information should be oral and written, and may include the following: What motor neurone disease is. Types and possible causes. Likely symptoms and how they can be managed. How motor neurone disease may progress. Treatment options. Where the person s appointments will take place. Which healthcare professionals and social care practitioners will undertake the person s care. Expected waiting times for consultations, investigations and treatments.

Local support groups, online forums and national charities, and how to get in touch with them. Legal rights, including social care support, employment rights and benefits. Requirements for disclosure, such as notifying the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Opportunities for advance care planning.When motor neurone disease is diagnosed, provide people with a single point of contact for the specialist motor neurone disease multidisciplinary team (see organisation of care). Provide information about what to do if there are any concerns between assessments or appointments, during  out-of-hours  or in an emergency, or if there is a problem with equipment.Offer the person with motor neurone disease a face-to-face, follow-up appointment with a healthcare professional from the multidisciplinary team, to take place within 4 weeks of diagnosis.When motor neurone disease is suspected or confirmed, inform the person s GP without delay and provide information about the likely prognosis.Set aside enough time to discuss the person s concerns and questions, which may include the following: What will happen to me?  Are there any treatments available? Is there a cure? How long will I live? What will the impact on my day-to-day life be? What will happen next with my healthcare?  Will my children get motor neurone disease? How do I tell my family and friends? How will I die?If the person has any social care needs, refer them to social services for an assessment. Be aware that some people with motor neurone disease may not have informal care available, and may live alone or care for someone else.Advise carers that they have a legal right to have a Carer s Assessment of their needs; support them with requesting this from their local authority.NICE has written information for the public on motor neurone disease.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Information and support at diagnosisSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Shorter time from first developing symptoms to time of diagnosis.Provide coordinated care for people with motor neurone disease, using a clinic-based, specialist motor neurone disease multidisciplinary team approach.

A healthcare professional with expertise in palliative care (motor neurone disease palliative care expertise may be provided by the neurologist or nurse in the multidisciplinary team, or by a specialist palliative care professional).The multidisciplinary team should have established relationships with, and prompt access to, the following: Clinical psychology and neuropsychology. Social care. Counselling. Respiratory ventilation services. Specialist palliative care. Gastroenterology. Orthotics.  Wheelchair services. Assistive technology services. AAC services. Community neurological care teams.Inform all healthcare professionals and social care practitioners involved in the person s care about key decisions reached with the person and their family members and/or carers (as appropriate).Ensure that all healthcare professionals and social care practitioners involved in the person s care are aware that motor neurone disease symptoms may get worse quickly, and that people with motor neurone disease will need repeated, ongoing assessments. Priority should be given to ensuring continuity of care and avoiding untimely case closure.Consider referral to a specialist palliative care team for people with current or anticipated significant or complex needs, for example, psychological or social distress, troublesome or rapidly progressing symptoms and complex future care planning needs.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
