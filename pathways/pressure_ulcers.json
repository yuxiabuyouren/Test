However, more evidence for their effectiveness in clinical practice is needed to support the case for routine adoption of Parafricta Bootees and Undergarments in the NHS.Research is recommended to address uncertainties about the claimed patient and system benefits of using Parafricta Bootees and Undergarments. This should take the form of comparative research against standard care, preferably carried out in a hospital. The research should include development of criteria to recognise people who would most benefit from the technology in both hospitals and community care.

Consider sharp and surgical debridement by trained staff if autolytic debridement is unsuccessful.The Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad The following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad for use in acute or chronic wounds.The case for adopting the Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad as part of the management of acute or chronic wounds in the community is supported by the evidence. The available evidence is limited, but the likely benefits of using the Debrisoft pad on appropriate wounds are that they will be fully debrided more quickly, with fewer nurse visits needed, compared with other debridement methods. In addition, the Debrisoft pad is convenient and easy to use, and is well tolerated by patients. Debridement is an important component of standard woundcare management as described in this interactive flowchart and foot care for people with diabetes.The Debrisoft pad is indicated for adults and children with acute or chronic wounds. The available evidence is mainly in adults with chronic wounds needing debridement in the community. The data show that the device is particularly effective for chronic sloughy wounds and hyperkeratotic skin around acute or chronic wounds. The Debrisoft pad is estimated to be cost saving for complete debridement compared with other debridement methods. When compared with hydrogel, gauze and bagged larvae, cost savings per patient (per complete debridement) are estimated to be \u00a399, \u00a3152 and \u00a3484 respectively in a community clinic and \u00a3222, \u00a3347 and \u00a3469 respectively in the home.

The available evidence is limited, but the likely benefits of using the Debrisoft pad on appropriate wounds are that they will be fully debrided more quickly, with fewer nurse visits needed, compared with other debridement methods. In addition, the Debrisoft pad is convenient and easy to use, and is well tolerated by patients. Debridement is an important component of standard woundcare management as described in this interactive flowchart and foot care for people with diabetes.The Debrisoft pad is indicated for adults and children with acute or chronic wounds. The available evidence is mainly in adults with chronic wounds needing debridement in the community. The data show that the device is particularly effective for chronic sloughy wounds and hyperkeratotic skin around acute or chronic wounds. The Debrisoft pad is estimated to be cost saving for complete debridement compared with other debridement methods. When compared with hydrogel, gauze and bagged larvae, cost savings per patient (per complete debridement) are estimated to be \u00a399, \u00a3152 and \u00a3484 respectively in a community clinic and \u00a3222, \u00a3347 and \u00a3469 respectively in the home.
