Stress that obesity is a clinical term with specific health implications, rather than a question of how people look; this may reduce any negative feelings. During the consultation: Assess the person s view of their weight and the diagnosis, and possible reasons for weight gain. Explore eating patterns and physical activity levels. Explore any beliefs about eating and physical activity and weight gain that are unhelpful if the person wants to lose weight. Be aware that people from certain ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds may be at greater risk of obesity, and may have different beliefs about what is a healthy weight and different attitudes towards weight management. Find out what the person has already tried and how successful this has been, and what they learned from the experience. Assess the person s readiness to adopt changes.

This may include vegetation, vending boards, bins, parked cars, scaffolding and street furniture.  Ensure that there are enough pedestrian-controlled crossings, and that they all incorporate accessibility features. Also ensure that signal-controlled crossings give enough time to cross the road safely. Provide accessible temporary crossings during street and road works (see the Department for Transport s Safety at street works and road works). Use and maintain tactile paving and dropped kerbs correctly (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces).  Provide step-free access or, where this is not possible, clearly signposted accessible alternatives. See why we made the recommendations on policies for people with limited mobility.subhead:Prioritise physical activity in daily lifeEnsure planning permissions always prioritise the need for people (including people with limited mobility) to be physically active as a routine part of their daily life, for example ensuring access on foot to local services such as shops and public transport stops.For more information see Public Health England s Spatial planning for health report. Ensure children, young people and their families and carers can be physically active, for example when playing and when travelling to school, college and early years settings.Use existing health impact assessment tools to assess in advance what impact (both intended and unintended) any proposed changes are likely to have on physical activity levels. For example, will local services be accessible on foot, by bike, and by people with limited mobility?

Current advertising restrictions have reduced the number of advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar during television programmes made for children and young people. However, advertisements, promotions, product placements and sponsorship shown between programmes for older audiences also have a powerful influence on children and young people. Marketing bans have been successfully introduced in several other countries; evidence shows that a 9pm watershed for such TV advertisements would reduce children and young people s exposure to this type of advertising by 82%Office of Communications (2006) Annex 7 \u2013 impact assessment. Annex to consultation on television advertising of food and drink to children. .Policy goalEnsure children and young people under 16 are protected from all forms of marketing, advertising and promotions (including product placements) which encourage an unhealthy diet. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsDevelop a comprehensive, agreed set of principles for food and beverage marketing aimed at children and young people. This could be similar to the  Sydney principles Swinburn B, Sacks G, Lobstein T et al. (2007) The  Sydney principles  for reducing the commercial promotion of foods and beverages to children. Public Health Nutrition 11 (9): 881\u20136.. They should be based on a child s right to a healthy diet.Extend TV advertising scheduling restrictions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar (as determined by the nutrient profile developed by the Food Standards Agency) up to 9pm.Develop equivalent standards, supported by legislation, to restrict the marketing, advertising and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar via all non-broadcast media. This includes manufacturers  websites, use of the Internet generally, mobile phones and other new technologies.Ensure restrictions for non-broadcast media on advertising, marketing and promotion of food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar are underpinned by the nutrient profiling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.subhead:Commercial interests ContextIf deaths and illnesses associated with cardiovascular disease are to be reduced, it is important that food and drink manufacturers, retailers, caterers, producers and growers, along with associated organisations, deliver goods that underpin this goal. Many commercial organisations are already taking positive action.Policy goalEnsure dealings between government, government agencies and the commercial sector are conducted in a transparent manner that supports public health objectives and is in line with best practice. (This includes full disclosure of interests.) To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage best practice for all meetings, including lobbying, between the food and drink industry and government (and government agencies). This includes full disclosure of interests by all parties. It also involves a requirement that information provided by the food and drink, catering and agriculture industries is available for the general public and is auditable.

High levels of salt in processed food have a major impact on the total amount consumed by the population. Over recent years the food industry, working with the Food Standards Agency, has made considerable progress in reducing salt in everyday foods. As a result, products with no added salt are now increasingly available. However, it is taking too long to reduce average salt intake among the population. Furthermore, average intake among children is above the recommended level \u2013 and some children consume as much salt as adults. Progress towards a low-salt diet needs to be accelerated as a matter of urgency.Policy goalReduce population-level consumption of salt. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAccelerate the reduction in salt intake among the population. Aim for a maximum intake of 6 g per day per adult by 2015 and 3 g by 2025.Ensure children s salt intake does not exceed age-appropriate guidelines (these guidelines should be based on up-to-date assessments of the available scientific evidence). Promote the benefits of a reduction in the population s salt intake to the European Union (EU). Introduce national legislation if necessary.Ensure national policy on salt in England is not weakened by less effective action in other parts of the EU.Ensure food producers and caterers continue to reduce the salt content of commonly consumed foods (including bread, meat products, cheese, soups and breakfast cereals). This can be achieved by progressively changing recipes, products and manufacturing and production methods.Establish the principle that children under 11 should consume substantially less salt than adults. (This is based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.)Support the Department of Health so that it can continue to promote \u2013 and take the lead on \u2013 the development of EU-wide salt targets for processed foods. Establish an independent system for monitoring national salt levels in commonly consumed foods.Ensure low-salt products are sold more cheaply than their higher salt equivalents. Clearly label products which are naturally high in salt and cannot meaningfully be reformulated. Use the traffic light system developed by the Food Standards Agency. The labels should also state that these products should only be consumed occasionally. Discourage the use of potassium and other substitutes to replace salt. The aim of avoiding potassium substitution is twofold: to help consumers  readjust their perception of  saltiness  and to avoid additives which may have other effects on health.Promote best practice in relation to the reduction of salt consumption, as exemplified in these recommendations, to the wider EU.subhead:Saturated fatsContextReducing general consumption of saturated fat is crucial to preventing CVD. Over recent years, much has been done (by the Food Standards Agency, consumers and industry) to reduce the population s intake. Consumption levels are gradually moving towards the goal set by the Food Standards Agency: to reduce population intake of saturated fat from 13.3% to below 11% of food energy. However, a further substantial reduction would greatly reduce CVD and deaths from CVD. Taking the example of Japan (where consumption of saturated fat is much lower than in the UK), halving the average intake (from 14% to 6\u20137% of total energy) might prevent approximately 30,000 CVD deaths annually. It would also prevent a corresponding number of new cases of CVD annually. (Note that low-fat products are not recommended for children under 2 years, but are fine thereafter.)Policy goal Reduce population-level consumption of saturated fat. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEncourage manufacturers, caterers and producers to reduce substantially the amount of saturated fat in all food products. If necessary, consider supportive legislation. Ensure no manufacturer, caterer or producer is at an unfair advantage as a result.Create the conditions whereby products containing lower levels of saturated fat are sold more cheaply than high saturated fat products. Consider legislation and fiscal levers if necessary.Create favourable conditions for industry and agriculture to produce dairy products for human consumption that are low in saturated fat.Continue to promote semi-skimmed milk for children aged over 2 years. This is in line with the American Heart Association s pediatric dietary strategyAmerican Heart Association (2005) Dietary recommendations for children and adolescents. A guide for practitioners: consensus statement from the American Heart Association. Circulation 112: 2061\u201375. Available at http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/13/2061.subhead:Trans fatsContextIPTFAs constitute a significant health hazard. In recent years many manufacturers and caterers, with the encouragement of the Food Standards Agency and other organisations, have considerably reduced the amount of IPTFAs in their products. However, certain sections of the population may be consuming a substantially higher amount of IPTFAs than average (for instance, those who regularly eat fried fast-food). It is important to protect all social groups from the adverse effects of IPTFAs. In some countries and regions (for instance, Denmark, Austria and New York), IPTFAs have been successfully banned. A study for the European Parliament recently recommended that it, too, should consider an EU-wide ban. In the meantime, some large UK caterers, retailers and producers have removed IPTFAs from their products.Policy goalEnsure all groups in the population are protected from the harmful effects of IPTFAs. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEliminate the use of IPTFAs for human consumption.In line with other EU countries (specifically, Denmark and Austria), introduce legislation to ensure that IPTFA levels do not exceed 2% in the fats and oils used in food manufacturing and cooking.Direct the bodies responsible for national surveys to measure and report on consumption of IPTFAs by different population subgroups \u2013 rather than only by mean consumption across the population as a whole.Establish guidelines for local authorities to monitor independently IPTFA levels in the restaurant, fast-food and home food trades using existing statutory powers (in relation to trading standards or environmental health).Create and sustain local and national conditions which support a reduction in the amount of IPTFAs in foods, while ensuring levels of saturated fat are not increased. Encourage the use of vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to replace oils containing IPTFAs. Saturated fats should not be used as an IPTFA substitute.Develop UK-validated guidelines and information for the food service sector and local government on removing IPTFAs from the food preparation process. This will support UK-wide implementation of any legislation produced on IPTFAs. SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. Align actions to promote physical activity with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see what NICE says on obesity: working with local communities).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. Apportion part of local transport funding to promote walking, cycling and other forms of travel that involve physical activity. The proportion allocated should be in line with growth targets for the use of these modes of transport.Ensure cycle tracks created under the Cycle Tracks Act 1984 are part of the definitive map (the legal record of public rights of way).subhead:Local transport plans \u2013 young peopleChildren and young people: key themes Promoting the benefits of physical activity and encouraging participation  Ensuring high-level strategic policy planning for children and young people supports the physical activity agenda  Consultation with, and the active involvement of, children and young people  The planning and provision of spaces, facilities and opportunities  The need for a skilled workforce  Promoting physically active and sustainable travel.What action should be taken?Ensure local transport and school travel plans continue to be fully aligned with other local authority plans which may impact on children and young people s physical activity. Liaise with local partnerships to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active.Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans. This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road. Consider how these policies can be improved to encourage physically active travel.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

(The latter provide highly cost-effective interventions to help people stop smoking in one step. See NICE s recommendations on stop smoking interventions and services). Develop smoking cessation referral and treatment pathways to ensure a range of approaches and interventions are available to support people who opt for a harm-reduction approach (see harm-reduction approaches).   Ensure the providers of stop smoking and other behaviour-change services offer people who smoke the approaches outlined above. Ensure services are available in the community, as part of primary and secondary healthcare and on offer from local authorities.Develop activity and outcome measures to assess the performance of service providers involved in supporting people who are using harm-reduction approaches. Measures of activity could include: numbers attending the services (to allow comparison with the numbers attending before harm-reductions options were offered)  classifying the approaches used  client characteristics (such as demographic data, cigarette usage, level of dependency and previous quit attempts) type and amount of licensed nicotine-containing products supplied or prescribed, and over-the-counter sales of these products number of people setting a quit date.Ensure service specifications include a requirement that providers of stop smoking services offer licensed nicotine-containing products on a long-term basis to help prevent a relapse among people who have stopped smoking.

Review at subsequent appointments, as appropriate.Where appropriate, for each of the stages above record smoking status, CO level, whether a referral is accepted or declined and any feedback given. This should be recorded in the woman s hand-held record. If a hand-held record is not available locally, use local protocols to record this information.ContextSome women find it difficult to say that they smoke because the pressure not to smoke during pregnancy is so intense. This, in turn, makes it difficult to ensure they are offered appropriate support.A CO test is an immediate and non-invasive biochemical method for helping to assess whether or not someone smokes. However, it is unclear as to what constitutes the best cut-off point for determining smoking status. Some suggest a CO level as low as 3 parts per million (ppm), others use a cut-off point of 6\u201310 ppm.It is important to note that CO quickly disappears from expired breath (the level can fall by 50% in less than 4 hours). As a result, low levels of smoking may go undetected and may be indistinguishable from passive smoking. Conversely, environmental factors such as traffic emissions or leaky gas appliances may cause a high CO reading \u2013 as may lactose intolerance.When trying to identify pregnant women who smoke, it is best to use a low cut-off point to avoid missing someone who may need help to quit.subhead:Actions for others in the public, community and voluntary sectorsWho should take action?Those responsible for providing health and support services for the target group of women.

The recommendations alone will not reverse the current obesity epidemic or other health trends associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.subhead:Implementing a physical activity programmeWho should take action?Employers in organisations of all sizes (in larger organisations this might include their representatives, for example, HR directors and senior managers).Public health professionals, occupational health professionals, workplace health promoters.Trades unions, other employee representatives, employees.What action should they take?Introduce and monitor an organisation-wide, multi-component programme to encourage and support employees to be physically active. This could be part of a broader programme to improve health. It could include: flexible working policies and incentive schemes policies to encourage employees to walk, cycle or use other modes of transport involving physical activity (to travel to and from work and as part of their working day) the dissemination of information (including written information) on how to be more physically active and on the health benefits of such activity. This could include information on local opportunities to be physically active (both within and outside the workplace) tailored to meet specific needs, for example, the needs of shift workers ongoing advice and support to help people plan how they are going to increase their levels of physical activity the offer of a confidential, independent health check administered by a suitably qualified practitioner and focused on physical activity.subhead:Components of the physical activity programmeWho should take action?Employers in organisations of all sizes (in larger organisations this might include their representatives, for example, HR directors and senior managers).People responsible for buildings and facilities.Public health professionals, occupational health professionals, workplace health promoters.Trades unions, other employee representatives, employees.What action should they take?Encourage employees to walk, cycle or use another mode of transport involving physical activity to travel part or all of the way to and from work (for example, by developing a travel plan).Help employees to be physically active during the working day by: where possible, encouraging them to move around more at work (for example, by walking to external meetings) putting up signs at strategic points and distributing written information to encourage them to use the stairs rather than lifts if they can providing information about walking and cycling routes and encouraging them to take short walks during work breaks encouraging them to set goals on how far they walk and cycle and to monitor the distances they cover.Take account of the nature of the work and any health and safety issues.

See why we made the recommendation on local areas with high potential.subhead:Public transportIncrease physical activity associated with using public transport services. This includes encouraging use of these services by: Ensuring available services are reliable, particularly in rural areas where public transport may be more limited. Making information about public transport services accessible to people with visual and hearing impairments, for example provide spoken and visual announcements about destinations and stops on board services, and at stops and stations.

This includes journeys between residential areas and: public transport stops and stations places of work public open spaces schools, colleges and early years settings healthcare services shops, and leisure sites.  Ensure footways, footpaths and cycle routes are convenient, safe and appealing to users, and are built and maintained to a high standard. For example, ensure: they are even and do not include any hazards, for example from tree roots, pot-holes, broken paving slabs or seasonal and weather-related obstructions they have enough lighting to make people feel secure they are free from permanent or temporary obstructions, where possible (see information on people with limited mobility in strategies, policies and plans)  they are not hidden by overgrown or poorly managed vegetation they have clear signs to help people find their way.Work in association with relevant third sector organisations and volunteers to plan and carry out this work.

See why we made the recommendations on footways, footpaths and cycle routes.subhead:Streets and roadsEnsure pedestrians, cyclists and users of other modes of transport that involve physical activity are given the highest priority when developing or maintaining streets and roads. (This includes people with limited mobility.) Use 1 or more of the following methods: Re-allocate road space to support physically active modes of transport (for example, by widening footways and introducing cycle lanes). For more detail on designing these routes, see the recommendations on active travel in NICE s guidance on air pollution, and the Department for Transport s guidance on Shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Restrict motor vehicle access (for example, by closing or narrowing roads to reduce capacity).  Introduce road-user charging schemes. For more detail on charging schemes, see clean air and congestion charging zones in NICE s recommendations on air pollution. Introduce traffic-calming schemes to restrict vehicle speeds (using signage and changes to highway design). For more detail on traffic calming, see the recommendations on smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s guidance on air pollution, recommendations on promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s and Department for Transport s guidance on traffic calming.  See why we made the recommendations on streets and roads.subhead:Cycling infrastructureImprove cycling infrastructure using information from people who walk, cycle, and drive in the local area, including those with limited mobility. See strategies, policies and plans. Improvements may include: establishing cycle lanes, tracks and trails in line with best practice  installing secure cycle parking facilities in public places, on public transport and at public transport stops.

For example: Ensure footways:  have even, non-reflective anti-glare surfaces are free from unauthorised and unnecessary obstructions (whether permanent or temporary) including being free from pavement parking (see strategies, policies and plans).  - are set back from traffic, if possible (for example, by a grass verge). Ensure footways that have a kerb clearly define the kerb with a change in level (apart from pedestrian crossings). Ensure pedestrian crossings have flush kerbs and tactile paving (see the Department for Transport s guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces). Ensure signal-controlled crossings have tactile rotating cones and, if appropriate, an audible beep, and give enough time to cross the road safely. Ensure tactile paving is correctly installed and maintained where it is needed, for example at all crossing places, at the top and bottom of stairs, on the edge of railway platforms and on shared use routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on tactile paving surfaces). Ensure seating is provided at regular intervals along footways that are key walking routes (see the Department for Transport s guidance on inclusive mobility.  See why we made the recommendations for people with limited mobility.subhead:School, college and early years settingsImprove routes that children, young people and their families and carers use, or could use, for active travel to school, college and early years settings. Focus on improving safety, accessibility, connectivity, sustainability and appeal to users. Consider improving access routes to school, college and early years settings by: improving footways and pedestrian crossings (see above)  introducing measures to reduce vehicle speed (see smooth driving and speed reduction in NICE s recommendations on air pollution) and promoting and enforcing speed reductions in NICE s guidance on unintentional injuries among under 15s).

The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.subhead:Responding to children and young peopleIdentify local factors that may affect whether or not children and young people are physically active by regularly consulting with them, their parents and carers.Find out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instruction for activities aimed at children and young peopleEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children.

Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment.

Telephone helplines and Internet support sites aimed at helping people to stop smoking.subhead:What action should they take?Identify people who smoke and advise them to stop smoking in one step as the best approach. See NICE s recommendations on stop smoking interventions and services, and the Department of Health s Stop smoking service delivery and monitoring guidance 2011/12. If someone does not want, is not ready or is unable to stop smoking in one step, ask if they would like to consider a harm-reduction approach. If they agree, help them to identify why they smoke, their smoking triggers and their smoking behaviour. Use this information to work through the harm-reduction approaches. Use professional judgement to suggest which approach(es) might be most suitable, based on the person s smoking behaviour, experience of previous quit attempts and their health and social circumstances. Briefly discuss the merits of each approach to help them choose. Ensure people know that licensed nicotine-containing products (such as nicotine patches, gum, or spray) make it is easier to cut down prior to stopping, or to reduce the amount they smoke. Explain that using these products also helps avoid compensatory smoking and increases the chances of stopping in the longer term.Recommend one or more licensed nicotine-containing products. If possible, supply or prescribe these products. Otherwise, encourage people to ask their GP or pharmacist for them, or tell them where they can buy the products themselves (see also offering licensed nicotine-containing products).Advise people that they can continue to use licensed nicotine-containing products in the long term, rather than risk relapsing after they have stopped, or reduced their smoking. If more intensive support is required, offer a referral to stop smoking services. These services provide pharmacotherapies and more comprehensive support and advice about harm reduction and stopping smoking in the longer term.  subhead:Supporting temporary abstinenceOffer people who want (or need) to abstain temporarily on a short-, medium- or longer-term basis advice on how to do this. Include information about the different types of licensed nicotine-containing products and how to use them. Where possible, prescribe them. (People might temporarily abstain in the short-term to comply with smokefree policies, for example, at work. Medium-term temporary abstinence may occur when admitted to hospital. Long-term temporary abstinence might occur during a custodial sentence.) Offer behavioural support to people who want (or need) to abstain temporarily. Support may be provided in one-to-one or group sessions by specialist services. It could include discussing why it is important to reduce the harm caused by smoking (to others as well as themselves). It could also include encouraging people to consider other times or situations when they could abstain.

Advise them to take 400 micrograms (\u00b5g) daily before pregnancy and throughout the first 12 weeks, even if they are already eating foods fortified with folic acid or rich in folate  advise all women who may become pregnant about a suitable folic acid supplement, such as the maternal Healthy Start vitamin supplements  encourage women to take folic acid supplements and to eat foods rich in folic acid (for example, fortified breakfast cereals and yeast extract) and to consume foods and drinks rich in folate (for example, peas and beans and orange juice). PCTs should ensure local education initiatives aimed at health professionals include information on the importance of folic acid supplements. They should provide the maternal Healthy Start vitamin supplements (folic acid, vitamins C and D) for eligible women. They should also ensure women who are not eligible for Healthy Start can obtain the supplements from their local pharmacy. GPs should prescribe 5 milligrams of folic acid a day for women who are planning a pregnancy, or are in the early stages of pregnancy, if they:  (or their partner) have a neural tube defect  have had a previous baby with a neural tube defect  (or their partner) have a family history of neural tube defects  have diabetes. subhead:Vitamin DEnsure health professionals recommend vitamin D supplementsLocal authorities, primary care and clinical commissioning groups should: Ensure computerised prompts on vitamin D are integrated into health and social care systems. Ensure health professionals recommend and record vitamin D supplement use among specific population groups  (and other family members, as appropriate) whenever possible. This could take place during registration appointments with new patients in general practice, flu, other vaccine and screening appointments. It could also take place during routine appointments and health checks including, for example: NHS Health Check diabetes check-ups falls appointments and check-ups health assessments for looked-after children the first contact with someone who is pregnant antenatal and postnatal appointments medicine use and prescription reviews health visitor appointments developmental checks for infants and children.Developers of standardised electronic and handheld maternity notes and developers of personal child health records (the  red book ) should add specific questions about the use of vitamin D supplements.All women should be informed at the booking appointment about the importance for their own and their baby s health of maintaining adequate vitamin D stores during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding. In order to achieve this, women should be advised to take a vitamin D supplement (10 micrograms of vitamin D per day), as found in the Healthy Start multivitamin supplement. Women who are not eligible for the Healthy Start benefit should be advised where they can buy the supplement. Particular care should be taken to enquire as to whether women at greatest risk are following advice to take this daily supplement. These include: women with darker skin (such as those of African, African\u2013Caribbean or South Asian family origin women who have limited exposure to sunlight, such as women who are housebound or confined indoors for long periods, or who cover their skin for cultural reasons.Testing vitamin D levelsHealth professionals should not routinely test people s vitamin D status unless:  they have symptoms of deficiency  they are considered to be at particularly high risk of deficiency (for example, they have very low exposure to sunlight)  there is a clinical reason to do so (for example, they have osteomalacia or have had a fall).Increase availability of vitamin D supplements for specific population groupsLocal authorities should ensure vitamin D supplements containing the recommended reference nutrient intake are widely available by:  Establishing arrangements with a range of settings to promote and distribute them. This could include local pharmacies, children s centres, midwifery and health visiting services and GP reception areas. Considering providing free supplements for specific population groups.  Encouraging pharmacies and other outlets selling food supplements (such as supermarkets) to stock the lowest cost vitamin D supplements and promote them to specific population groups.  Ensure improvements in the availability of vitamin D supplements are supported by local awareness-raising activities (see NICE s recommendations on raise awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplements and training and professional development in relation to vitamin D supplement use in specific population groups).subhead:Healthy StartHealth professionals should advise pregnant women and parents of children under 4 years about the Healthy Start scheme. They should ensure all women who may be eligible receive an application form as early as possible in pregnancy. Health professionals should use every opportunity they have to offer those parents who are eligible for the Healthy Start scheme practical, tailored information, support and advice on:  how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase their fruit and vegetable intake.Health professionals should offer the maternal Healthy Start vitamin supplement (folic acid, vitamins C and D) to pregnant women who are (or who may be) eligible. Community pharmacists should ensure the Healthy Start maternal vitamin supplements are available for purchase by women who are not eligible to receive them free of charge. Diet in pregnancyEarly in pregnancy, discuss the woman s diet and eating habits and find out and address any concerns she may have about her diet. Provide information on the benefits of a healthy diet and practical advice on how to eat healthily throughout pregnancy. This should be tailored to the woman s circumstances. The advice should include: eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and one portion of oily fish (for example, mackerel, sardines, pilchards, herring, trout or salmon) a week. subhead:Diet for breastfeedingAdvise mothers that a healthy diet is important for everyone and that they do not need to modify their diet to breastfeed.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.subhead:Responding to children and young peopleFind out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instructionEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers.

This includes local partnership agreements, local area play strategies and healthy school plans. Liaise with local partners to achieve this. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans (see recommendation below). This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Organise training courses for school travel plan advisers.subhead:Active and sustainable school travel plansContinue to encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as walking or cycling).Develop a school travel plan which has physical activity as a key aim, in line with existing guidance \u2013 see Making school travel plans work. Integrate it with the travel plans of other local schools and the local community (see above). The aim is to encourage children and young people to choose physically active modes of travel throughout their school career.Ensure schools provide suitable cycle and road safety training for all pupils.Encourage children and young people, especially those who live within a 2-mile radius of their school or other community facilities, to walk, cycle or use another mode of physically active travel to get there.Work with local authorities to map safe routes to school and to local play and leisure facilities. Take into account the views of pupils, parents and carers and consult with the local community. Overcome any barriers that are identified (for example, a lack of secure cycle parking).Involve children and young people, their parents and carers, the local community and external agencies in implementing the school travel plan. Use a mix of measures to promote it (for example, walking buses, walk and bike to school days). Work with the local authority school travel plan adviser to recruit volunteers on a long-term basis to help implement it.Set performance targets for school travel plans which are audited annually and which form part of delivery plans for local partnerships. Remedial action should be taken when agreed targets are not reached.Develop parents  and carers  awareness of the wider benefits of walking and cycling and other physically active modes of travel. For example, explain how it can improve children and young people s movement skills, social wellbeing, self-confidence and independence. Also explain how it can help children to explore and become more familiar (and at ease) with their local environment while, at the same time, being physically active.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Any changes in physical activity, physical skills and health outcomes should be recorded. Identify a senior council member to be a champion for children and young people s physical activity. They should: promote the importance of encouraging physical activity as part of all council portfolios ensure physical activity is a key priority when developing local authority programmes and targets promote partnership working with council member leads of relevant departments (for example, transport, leisure and health) explain to the public the local authority s role in promoting physical activity.subhead:Developing physical activity plans for childrenIdentify groups of local children and young people who are unlikely to participate in at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. Work with the public health observatory, schools and established community partnerships and voluntary organisations to achieve this.Involve these children and young people in the design, planning and delivery of physical activity opportunities, using the information gathered.Consult with different groups of children and young people and their families on a regular basis to understand the factors that help or prevent them from being physically active. Pay particular attention to those who are likely to be less physically active. Ensure children and young people from different socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are actively involved in the provision of activities. Also ensure those with a disability (or who are living with a family member who has a disability) are actively involved.Use the information gathered to increase opportunities for children and young people to be physically active and to plan dedicated programmes that tackle any inequalities in provision. For further recommendations on community engagement, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement.subhead:Planning the provision of spaces and facilities for children Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels.Align actions to promote physical activity with strategies to prevent obesity at a community level to ensure a coherent, integrated approach (see NICE s recommendations on obesity: working with local communities).SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instruction for activities aimed at children and young peopleEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment.

Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.The recommendations below should be implemented before those in CVD programme resources, leadership and evaluation.subhead:Good practice principlesEnsure a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programme comprises intense, multi-component interventions.Ensure it takes into account issues identified in this guidance. See also NICE s recommendations on cardiovascular disease prevention.Ensure it includes initiatives aimed at the whole population (such as local policy and regulatory initiatives) which complement existing programmes aimed at individuals at high risk of CVD.Ensure it is sustainable for a minimum of 5 years.Ensure appropriate time and resources are allocated for all stages, including planning and evaluation.subhead:PreparationGain a good understanding of the prevalence and incidence of CVD in the community. Find out about any previous CVD prevention initiatives that have been run (including any positive or negative experiences).Consider how existing policies relating to food, tobacco control and physical activity, including those developed by the local authority, may impact on the prevalence of CVD locally.Gauge the community s level of knowledge of, and beliefs about, CVD risk factors. This includes beliefs that smoking is the only solace in life for people with little money, or that only people who have a lot of money eat salad.Gauge how confident people in the community are that they can change their behaviour to reduce the risks of CVD. See NICE s recommendations on behaviour change.Identify groups of the population who are disproportionately affected by CVD and develop strategies with them to address their needs.Take into account the community s exposure to risk factors (factors currently facing adults and those emerging for children and younger people).subhead:Programme developmentDevelop a population-based approach. Ensure a  programme theory  is developed and used to underpin the programmeEvidence based policy: 2. The promise of  realist synthesis . This should cover the reasons why particular actions are expected to have particular outcomes.Ensure the programme helps address local targets and tackles health inequalities.Link the programme with existing strategies for targeting people at particularly high risk of CVD and take account of ongoing, accredited screening activities by GPs and other healthcare professionals. This includes the NHS Health Checks programme.Work closely with local authorities and other organisations covering specific areas to promote policies which are likely to encourage healthier eating, tobacco control and increased physical activity. Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups).When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations made within this guidance. Also see what NICE says on smoking, behaviour change, community engagement and diet. Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors. Media campaigns should be based on an acknowledged theoretical framework.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Children should be supervised at mealtimes and, if possible, staff should eat with children.subhead:Encouraging a healthy diet and lifestyleHelp children and young people to have a healthy diet and lifestyle. This includes helping them to develop positive, life-long habits in relation to food. This can be achieved by ensuring the messages conveyed about food, the food and drink available \u2013 and where it is consumed \u2013 is conducive to a healthy diet.

For example, this could include providing drop-in or community-based services, outreach and out-of-hours services, advice and help in the workplace and single-sex sessions.Involve people who are disadvantaged in the planning and development of services. Seek feedback from the target groups on whether the services are accessible, appropriate and meeting their needs.Gain the trust of adults who are disadvantaged. Offer them proactive support. This could include helplines, brochures and invitations to attend services. It could also include providing GPs with postal prompts to remind them to monitor people who are disadvantaged and who have had an acute coronary event.Develop and deliver non-judgemental programmes to tackle social and psychological barriers to change. These should be tailored to people s needs. For example, they could make use of social marketing techniques. (Social marketing involves using marketing and related techniques to achieve specific behavioural goals.)Ensure services are sensitive to culture, gender and age. For example, provide multi-lingual literature in a culturally acceptable style and involve community, religious and lay groups in its production. Where appropriate, offer translation and interpretation facilities. Promote services using culturally relevant local and national media, as well as representatives of different ethnic groups. Consider providing information in video or web-based format.Provide services in places that are easily accessible to people who are disadvantaged (such as community pharmacies and shopping centres) and at times to suit them.Provide support to ensure people who are disadvantaged can attend appointments (for example, this may include help with transport, postal prompts and offering home visits).Encourage and support people who are disadvantaged to follow the treatment that they have agreed to. For example, encourage them to use self-management techniques (based on an individual assessment) to solve problems and set goals. It could also involve providing vouchers for treatments (such as NRT). See NICE s recommendations on the principles of behaviour change.Routinely search GP databases (and other electronic medical records) to generate lists of patients who have not collected repeat prescriptions or attended follow-up appointments. Make contact with them.Address factors that prevent people who are disadvantaged from using services (for example, they may have a fear of failure or of being judged, or they might not know what services and treatments are available).Support the development and implementation of regional and national strategies to tackle health inequalities by delivering local activities which are proven to be effective.Use health equity audits to determine if services are reaching people who are disadvantaged and whether they are effectiveHealth equity audits typically consist of six steps: 1) Agreeing partners and issues for the audit, 2) Undertaking an equity profile, 3) Identifying high-impact local action to narrow key inequities identified, 4) Agreeing priorities for action, 5) Securing changes in investment and service delivery and 6) Reviewing progress and assessing impact.

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child.Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute. What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable source. Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intakeThis is an edited extract from a recommendation that appears in Maternal and child nutrition  (NICE public health guidance 11).  of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments). Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy \u2013 see the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsNICE recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. See NICE s recommendations on obesity. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects. Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods.Explain to women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child. Explain that they should not try to reduce this risk by dieting while pregnant and that the risk will be managed by the health professionals caring for them during pregnancy.Offer women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more a referral to a dietician or appropriately trained health professional for assessment and personalised advice on healthy eating and how to be physically active. Encourage them to lose weight after pregnancy.subhead:Supporting women after childbirth During the 6-8-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache). Midwives and other health professionals should encourage women to breastfeed. They should reassure them that a healthy diet and regular, moderate-intensity physical activity and gradual weight loss will not adversely affect the ability to breastfeed or the quantity or quality of breast milk. Health professionals should give advice on recreational exercise from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In summary, this states that: If pregnancy and delivery are uncomplicated, a mild exercise programme consisting of walking, pelvic floor exercises and stretching may begin immediately. But women should not resume high-impact activity too soon after giving birth. After complicated deliveries, or lower segment caesareans, a medical care-giver should be consulted before resuming pre-pregnancy levels of physical activity, usually after the first check-up at 6-8 weeks after giving birth. Health professionals should also emphasise the importance of participating in physical activities, such as walking, which can be built into daily life. subhead:Community-based services Local authority leisure and community services should offer women with babies and children the opportunity to take part in a range of physical or recreational activities. This could include swimming, organised walks, cycling or dancing. Activities need to be affordable and available at times that are suitable for women with older children as well as those with babies. Where possible, affordable childcare (for example, a cr\u00e8che) should be provided and provision made for women who wish to breastfeed. Weight management groups and slimming clubs should adhere to the principles outlined at the beginning of this section. This includes giving advice about healthy eating and the importance of physical activity and using evidence-based behaviour-change techniques to motivate and support women to lose weight.Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should advise women that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both them and their unborn child during pregnancy. They should also explain that it will help them to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth \u2013 and could encourage the whole family to eat healthily and be physically active. Health trainers and health and fitness advisers should encourage those who have weight concerns before, during or after pregnancy to talk to a health professional such as a GP, practice nurse, dietician, health visitor or pharmacist. They should also advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice on healthy eating and physical activity from a reputable source. subhead:Professional skills Ensure health professionals, healthcare assistants and support workers have the skills to advise on the health benefits of weight management and risks of being overweight or obese before, during and after pregnancy, or after successive pregnancies. Ensure they can advise women on their nutritional needs before, during and after pregnancy and can explain why it is important to have a balanced diet and to be moderately physically active. Ensure they have behaviour change knowledge, skills and competencies. This includes being able to help people to identify how their behaviour is affecting their health, draw up an action plan, make the changes and maintain them. Ensure they have the communication techniques needed to broach the subject of weight management in a sensitive manner. They should be able to give women practical advice on how to improve their diet and become more physically active. They should be able to tailor this advice to individual needs and know when to refer them for specialist care and support. Ensure they have knowledge, skills and competencies in group facilitation, are aware of the needs of minority ethnic groups and have knowledge of local services. Ensure their training is regularly monitored and updated.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Undertake a systematic process to calculate the midwifery staffing establishment. The process (or parts of the process) could be supported by a NICE endorsed toolkit (if available). The process should contain the following components. Use historical data about the number and care needs of women who have accessed maternity services over a sample period (for example, the past 12 months or longer). Estimate the total maternity care hours needed over the sample period based on a risk categorisation of women and babies in the service. This should consider the following: risk factors, acuity and dependency (see consider risk, acuity and dependency of each woman and baby when assessing maternity care needs for examples) the estimated time taken to perform all routine maternity care activities (see part A in examples of maternity care activities that affect midwifery staffing) the estimated time taken to perform additional activities (see part B in examples of maternity care activities that affect midwifery staffing). Divide the total number of maternity care hours by the number of women in the time period to determine the historical average maternity care hours needed per woman. Use data on the number of women who are currently accessing the maternity service and the trend in new bookings to predict the number of women in the service in the next 6 months.  Multiply the predicted number of women in the service over the next 6 months by the historical average maternity care hours needed per woman to determine the predicted total maternity care hours needed over the next 6 months.  From the total predicted maternity care hours, identify the hours of midwife time and skill mix to deliver the maternity care activities that are required. Take account of: environmental factors including local service configuration (see examples of environmental factors to consider when assessing maternity care needs) the range of staff available, such as maternity support workers, registered nurses or GPs, and the activities that can be safely delegated to or provided by them (see examples of staffing factors to consider when assessing maternity care needs). Allow for the following: one-to-one care during established labour (unless already accounted for in the historical data) more than one-to-one care during established labour if circumstances require it (unless already accounted for in the historical data) any staffing ratios for other stages of care that have been developed locally depending on the local service configuration and the needs of individual women and babies the locally defined rate of uplift (for example, to allow for annual leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, study leave, special leave and sickness absence).   Divide the total midwife hours by 26 to give the average number of midwife hours needed per week over the next 6 months. Divide the weekly average by the number of hours for a full time working week to determine the number of whole time equivalents needed for the midwife establishment over the next 6 months.  Convert the number of whole time equivalents into the annual midwife establishment.See systematic process to calculate the midwifery staffing establishment in the guideline for a summary of this process. Base the number of whole-time equivalents on registered midwives, and do not include the following in the calculations: registered midwives undertaking a Local Supervising Authority Programme registered midwives with supernumerary status (this may include newly qualified midwives, or midwives returning to practice) student midwives the proportion of time specialist and consultant midwives who are part of the establishment spend delivering contracted specialist work (for example, specialist midwives in bereavement roles) the proportion of time midwives who are part of the establishment spend coordinating a service, for example the labour ward. Use professional judgement at each stage of the calculation and when checking the calculations for the midwifery staffing establishment.Base the midwife roster on the midwifery staffing establishment calculations, taking into account any predictable peaks in activity, and risk categorisation of women and babies (for example, during the day when midwife activities are likely to be planned, or for a service dealing with higher risk category women and babies).Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.2One-to-one careSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Community pharmacists should ensure the Healthy Start maternal vitamin supplements are available for purchase by women who are not eligible to receive them free of charge. Diet in pregnancyEarly in pregnancy, discuss the woman s diet and eating habits and find out and address any concerns she may have about her diet. Provide information on the benefits of a healthy diet and practical advice on how to eat healthily throughout pregnancy. This should be tailored to the woman s circumstances. The advice should include: eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and one portion of oily fish (for example, mackerel, sardines, pilchards, herring, trout or salmon) a week. subhead:Diet for breastfeedingAdvise mothers that a healthy diet is important for everyone and that they do not need to modify their diet to breastfeed.

Investing in the health of employees can also bring business benefits such as reduced sickness absence, increased loyalty and better staff retention.NICE s recommendations aim to help employers and workplace health professionals prevent the diseases associated with a lack of physical activity. The recommendations alone will not reverse the current obesity epidemic or other health trends associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, efforts made in the workplace, alongside wider strategies to increase physical activity levels, could help improve people s health significantly.What action should be taken?Ensure physical activity facilities are suitable for children and young people with different needs and their families, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.Provide children and young people with places and facilities (both indoors and outdoors) where they feel safe taking part in physical activities. These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Public open spacesSee recommendations on making public spaces accessible and appealing in public open spaces.subhead:General environmental improvementsA national framework for actionCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem. Changes in the risk factors can be brought about by intervening at the population and individual level. Government has addressed \u2013 and continues to address \u2013 the risk factors at both levels.Interventions focused on changing an individual s behaviour are important. But changes at the population level could lead to further substantial benefits. Population-level changes may be achieved in a number of ways but national or regional policy and legislation are particularly powerful levers. See prevention of cardiovascular disease. The national framework would be established through policy, led by the Department of Health. It would involve government, government agencies, industry and key, non-governmental organisations working together.The final decision on whether these policy options are adopted \u2013 and how they are prioritised \u2013 will be determined by government through normal political processes.Physically active travelTravel offers an important opportunity to help people become more physically active. However, inactive modes of transport have increasingly dominated in recent years. In England, schemes to encourage people to opt for more physically active forms of travel (such as walking and cycling) are  patchy .What action should be taken?Ensure the physical environment encourages people to be physically active. Implement changes where necessary. This includes prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over motorists when developing or redeveloping highways. It also includes developing and implementing public sector workplace travel plans that incorporate physical activity \u2013 see physical activity programmes including active travel. Encourage and support employers in other sectors to do the same.Ensure the need for children and young people to be physically active is addressed. This includes providing adequate play spaces and opportunities for formal and informal physical activity.Audit bye-laws and amend those that prohibit physical activity in public spaces (such as those that prohibit ball games).Align all  planning gain  agreements with the promotion of heart health to ensure there is funding to support physically active travel. (For example, Section 106 agreements are sometimes used to bring development in line with sustainable development.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This could be part of a broader programme to improve health. It could include: flexible working policies and incentive schemes policies to encourage employees to walk, cycle or use other modes of transport involving physical activity (to travel to and from work and as part of their working day) the dissemination of information (including written information) on how to be more physically active and on the health benefits of such activity. This could include information on local opportunities to be physically active (both within and outside the workplace) tailored to meet specific needs, for example, the needs of shift workers ongoing advice and support to help people plan how they are going to increase their levels of physical activity the offer of a confidential, independent health check administered by a suitably qualified practitioner and focused on physical activity.subhead:Components of the physical activity programmeEncourage employees to walk, cycle or use another mode of transport involving physical activity to travel part or all of the way to and from work (for example, by developing a travel plan).Help employees to be physically active during the working day by: where possible, encouraging them to move around more at work (for example, by walking to external meetings) putting up signs at strategic points and distributing written information to encourage them to use the stairs rather than lifts if they can providing information about walking and cycling routes and encouraging them to take short walks during work breaks encouraging them to set goals on how far they walk and cycle and to monitor the distances they cover.Take account of the nature of the work and any health and safety issues. For example, many people already walk long distances during the working day, while those involved in shift work may be vulnerable if walking home alone at night.subhead:Travel plans, showers and secure cycle parking In their role as employers, NHS organisations should set an example in developing public health policies to prevent and manage obesity by following existing guidance and (in England) the local obesity strategy. In particular, there should be policies, facilities and information that promote physical activity, for example, through travel plans, by providing showers and secure cycle parking and by using signposting and improved d\u00e9cor to encourage stair use.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This could be done, for example: when the opportunity arises during a consultation with a primary care practitioner or while people are waiting  as part of a planned session on management of long-term conditions. Use professional judgement to determine when this assessment would be most appropriate, for example, when someone is presenting with a condition that could be alleviated by physical activity. When assessing activity levels, remain sensitive to people s overall circumstances. If it is not appropriate during the current consultation, carry out an assessment at the next available opportunity.Do not rely on visual cues (for example, body weight). Use validated tools such as GPPAQThe general practice physical activity questionnaire (GPPAQ) is an example of a validated questionnaire for assessing someone s (aged 16-74) current level of physical activity. The index can be cross-referred to Read Codes and can be used to determine whether brief advice might be appropriate.  to assess physical activity levels.For people who are not meeting the UK guidelines, identify the most appropriate time to discuss physical activity with them. This might be during the current consultation or in a later consultation, and might involve referral to another member of the primary care team. If they agree to a future consultation, make sure it occurs at the earliest opportunity. Ensure the person at least leaves the initial consultation aware of the health benefits of physical activity (see benefits of physical activity).  Record the outcomes of the physical activity assessment. Use Read Codes if appropriate.  Encourage people who are assessed as meeting the UK physical activity guidelines (see physical activity: definition and current UK recommendations) to maintain this level of activity.head:Delivering and following up on brief advice Advise adults who have been assessed as being inactive to do more physical activity, with the aim of achieving the UK physical activity guidelines.

Provide information about local opportunities to be physically active for people with a range of abilities, preferences and needs. Consider giving a written outline of the advice and goals that have been discussed.Record the outcomes of the discussion. Follow up when there is another appointment or opportunity.

This may include increasing the time interval between cigarettes, delaying the first cigarette of the day or choosing periods during the day, or specific occasions, when they will not smoke. Help people who are cutting down prior to stopping smoking to set a specific quit date. The quit date should normally be within 6 weeks from the start of receiving behavioural support, although the sooner the better. Help them to develop a schedule detailing how much they aim to cut down (and when) in the lead up to that date. Help people who are aiming to reduce the amount they smoke (but not intending to stop) to set a date when they will have achieved their goal.

Do not use unduly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced diets, because they are ineffective in the long term and can be harmful.Encourage people to improve their diet even if they do not lose weight, because there can be other health benefits.The main requirement of a dietary approach to weight loss is that total energy intake should be less than energy expenditure.Diets that have a 600 kcal/day deficit (that is, they contain 600 kcal less than the person needs to stay the same weight) or that reduce calories by lowering the fat content (low-fat diets), in combination with expert support and intensive follow-up, are recommended for sustainable weight loss. Consider low-calorie diets (800\u20131,600 kcal/day), but be aware these are less likely to be nutritionally complete. Do not routinely use very-low-calorie diets (800 kcal/day or less) to manage obesity (defined as BMI over 30).Only consider very-low-calorie diets, as part of a multicomponent weight management strategy, for people who are obese and who have a clinically assessed need to rapidly lose weight (for example, people who need joint replacement surgery or who are seeking fertility services). Ensure that: the diet is nutritionally complete the diet is followed for a maximum of 12 weeks (continuously or intermittently) the person following the diet is given ongoing clinical support.Before starting someone on a very-low-calorie diet as part of a multi-component weight management strategy: Consider counselling and assess for eating disorders or other psychopathology to make sure the diet is appropriate for them. Discuss the risks and benefits with them. Tell them that this is not a long-term weight management strategy, and that regaining weight may happen and is not because of their own or their clinician s failure. Discuss the reintroduction of food following a liquid diet with them.Provide a long-term multicomponent strategy to help the person maintain their weight after the use of a very-low-calorie diet (see lifestyle changes for adults who are overweight or obese in NICE s recommendations on obesity).Encourage people to eat a balanced diet in the long term, consistent with other healthy eating advice.

To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.subhead:Recommended actionsEstablish the single, integrated, front-of-pack traffic light colour-coded system developed by the Food Standards Agency as the national standard for food and drink products sold in England. This includes the simple, traffic light, colour-coding visual icon and text which indicates whether food or drink contains a  high ,  medium  or  low  level of salt, fat or sugar. It also includes text to indicate the product s percentage contribution to the guideline daily amount (GDA) from each category.Consider using legislation to ensure universal implementation of the front-of-pack traffic light labelling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.Develop and implement nutritional labelling for use on shelves or packaging for bread, cakes, meat and dairy products displayed in a loose or unwrapped state or packed on the premises. The labelling should be consistent with the traffic light labelling system developed by the Food Standards Agency.Ensure food and drink labelling is consistent in format and content. In particular, it should refer to salt (as opposed to sodium), the content per 100 g and use kcals as the measure of energy.Continue to support the Department of Health in providing clear information about healthy eating.Ensure the UK continues to set the standard of best practice by pursuing exemption from potentially less effective EU food labelling regulations when appropriate.

To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered. subhead:Recommended actionsEncourage local planning authorities to restrict planning permission for take-aways and other food retail outlets in specific areas (for example, within walking distance of schools). Help them implement existing planning policy guidance in line with public health objectives.

The burden of diet-related disease has grown considerably since CAP was first implemented. CAP reform offers a significant opportunity to address the burden of CVD. However, there are still a number of significant  distortions  in relation to certain food prices and production processes which potentially increase the burden of disease. Further reform should aim to remove these distortions to promote health and wellbeing and to provide a basis for UK government action to prevent CVDLloyd Williams F, Mwatsama M, Birt C et al. (2008) Estimating the cardiovascular mortality burden attributable to the European Common Agricultural Policy on dietary saturated fats. Geneva: World Health Organization. Lock K, Pomerleau J (2005) Fruit and vegetable policy in the European Union: its effect on cardiovascular disease. Brussels: European Health Network.. The CAP has two main  pillars : market measures (first pillar) and rural development policy (second pillar). Recent CAP reform has shifted money from the first to the second pillar which now focuses more on  public goods . However, health has not been formally recognised as a  public good . CAP reforms have begun to address this issue, but a clearer focus on CVD and its antecedents (that is, the production of foods high in fat, sugar or salt) is needed.subhead:Policy goalsEnsure promoting health and reducing disease is made an explicit part of the CAP s  public goods  so that European money promotes the wellbeing of EU citizens. (The scope of what are regarded as  European public goods  in the EU is broader than the strict definition of a  public good  used by some economists.)Ensure CAP spending takes adequate account of its potential impact on CVD risk factors and is used in a way that optimises the public health outcomes. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsNegotiate at EU and national level to ensure the CAP takes account of public health issues. Health benefits should be an explicit, legitimate outcome of CAP spending. This can be achieved through formal recognition of health as a  public good .Progressively phase out payments under  pillar one  so that all payments fall under  pillar two . This will allow for better protection of health, climate and the environment. It will also improve and stimulate economic growth.Encourage the principle that future  pillar two  funds should reward or encourage the production of highly nutritious foods such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains and leaner meats.Negotiate to ensure the European Commission s impact assessment procedure takes cardiovascular health and other health issues into account. (Impact assessment is part of the European Commission s strategic planning and programming cycle.)SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The Department of Health has published health impact assessment tools to help organisations including, where relevant, government departments, assess the impact of policies on the health of the population. Policy goalsEnsure government policy is assessed for its impact on CVD. Ensure any such assessments are adequately incorporated into the policy making process. To achieve this, the following are among the measures that should be considered. Recommended actionsAssess (in line with the Cabinet Office recommendations) all public policy and programmes for the potential impact (positive and negative) on CVD and other related chronic diseases. In addition, assess the potential impact on health inequalities. Assessments should be carried out using health and policy impact assessment and other similar, existing tools.Monitor the outcomes of policy and programmes after the assessment and use them to follow up and amend future plans.Make health impact assessment mandatory in specific scenarios. (Note that strategic environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment and regulatory impact assessment are already mandatory in certain contexts.)See also the recommendations on local and regional health impact assessments.subhead:MonitoringContextCVD is responsible for around 33% of the observed gap in life expectancy among people living in areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators compared with those living elsewhere in England. Independent monitoring, using a full range of available data, is vital when assessing the need for additional measures to address such health inequalities, including those related to CVD. Policy goalEnsure all appropriate data are available for monitoring and analysis to inform CVD prevention policy. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered.Recommended actionsEnsure data on CVD prevention is available for scrutiny by the public health community as a whole.Ensure new econometric data (including pooled consumer purchasing data) are rapidly made available by industry for monitoring and analysis by independent agencies.Use population surveys (including the National diet and nutrition survey [NDNS] and the Low income diet and nutrition survey [LIDNS]) and data from all relevant sources to monitor intake of nutrients for all population groups. (Sources include: the Department of Health, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Office for National Statistics, the Public Health Observatories, academic and other researchers.)Monitor the intake of salt, trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids among different population groups and report the findings for those groups.Support the National diet and nutrition survey and the Low income diet and nutrition survey. Ensure the CVD module (including lipid profile measures) routinely appears in the Health surveys for England.Develop an international public health information system (resembling GLOBALink) for CVD prevention and use it to ensure widespread dissemination of these data.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

It is estimated that they provide around one in three meals eaten outside the home. Hence, an effective way to reduce the risk of CVD would be to improve the nutritional quality of the food and drink they provide. subhead:Policy goalsEnsure publicly funded food and drink provision contributes to a healthy, balanced diet and the prevention of CVD.Ensure public sector catering practice offers a good example of what can be done to promote a healthy, balanced diet.

This includes local partnership agreements, local area play strategies and healthy school plans. Liaise with local partners to achieve this. Ensure local transport plans continue to be developed in conjunction with local authority departments and other agencies that provide spaces and facilities for children and young people to be physically active. Ensure local transport plans acknowledge any potential impact on opportunities for children and young people to be physically active. Transport plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel. They should make provision for the additional needs of, or support required by, children, young people and their parents or carers with a disability or impaired mobility. Continue working with schools to develop, implement and promote school travel plans (see recommendation below). This may, for example, include: mapping safe routes to school; organising walk and bike to school days and walking buses; organising cycle and road safety training; and helping children to be  streetwise .Organise training courses for school travel plan advisers.Identify any aspect of transport policies which discourages children and young people from using modes of travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling). For example, policies that aim to keep traffic moving may make it difficult to cross the road. Consider how these policies can be improved to encourage physically active travel.subhead:Active and sustainable school travel plansContinue to encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as walking or cycling).Develop a school travel plan which has physical activity as a key aim \u2013 see Making school travel plans work. Integrate it with the travel plans of other local schools and the local community (see above). The aim is to encourage children and young people to choose physically active modes of travel throughout their school career.Ensure schools provide suitable cycle and road safety training for all pupils.Encourage children and young people, especially those who live within a 2-mile radius of their school or other community facilities, to walk, cycle or use another mode of physically active travel to get there.Work with local authorities to map safe routes to school and to local play and leisure facilities. Take into account the views of pupils, parents and carers and consult with the local community. Overcome any barriers that are identified (for example, a lack of secure cycle parking).Involve children and young people, their parents and carers, the local community and external agencies in implementing the school travel plan. Use a mix of measures to promote it (for example, walking buses, walk and bike to school days). Work with the local authority school travel plan adviser to recruit volunteers on a long-term basis to help implement it.Set performance targets for school travel plans which are audited annually and which form part of delivery plans for local partnerships. Remedial action should be taken when agreed targets are not reached.Develop parents  and carers  awareness of the wider benefits of walking and cycling and other physically active modes of travel. For example, explain how it can improve children and young people s movement skills, social wellbeing, self-confidence and independence. Also explain how it can help children to explore and become more familiar (and at ease) with their local environment while, at the same time, being physically active.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These could be provided by the public, voluntary, community and private sectors (for example, in schools, youth clubs, local business premises and private leisure facilities). Local authorities should coordinate the availability of facilities, where appropriate. They should also ensure all groups have access to these facilities, including those with disabilities.Make school facilities available to children and young people before, during and after the school day, at weekends and during school holidays. These facilities should also be available to public, voluntary, community and private sector groups and organisations offering physical activity programmes and opportunities for physically active play.Actively promote public parks and facilities as well as more non-traditional spaces (for example, car parks outside working hours) as places where children and young people can be physically active.Town planners should make provision for children, young people and their families to be physically active in an urban setting. They should ensure open spaces and outdoor facilities encourage physical activity (including activities which are appealing to children and young people, for example, in-line skating). They should also ensure physical activity facilities are located close to walking and cycling routes.Ensure the spaces and facilities used for physical activity meet recommended safety standards for design, installation and maintenance. For example, outdoor play areas should have areas of shade from the sun and sheltered areas where children can play to reduce the impact of adverse weather.Assess all proposals for signs restricting physical activity in public spaces and facilities (such as those banning ball games) to judge the effect on physical activity levels. subhead:Responding to children and young peopleIdentify local factors that may affect whether or not children and young people are physically active by regularly consulting with them, their parents and carers.Find out what type of physical activities children and young people enjoy, based on existing research or local consultation (for example, some might prefer non-competitive or single-gender activities). Actively involve them in planning the resulting physical activities.Remove locally identified barriers to participation, such as lack of privacy in changing facilities, inadequate lighting, poorly maintained facilities and lack of access for children and young people with a disability. Any dress policy should be practical, affordable and acceptable to participants without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide regular local programmes and other opportunities for children and young people to be physically active in a challenging environment where they feel safe (both indoors and outdoors). Ensure these programmes and opportunities are well-publicised.Ensure physical activity programmes are run by people with the relevant training or experience.subhead:Leadership and instructionEnsure informal and formal physical activity sessions for children and young people (including play) are led by staff or volunteers who have achieved the relevant sector standards or qualifications for working with children. This includes the requirements for child protection, health and safety, equality and diversity.Ensure staff and volunteers have the skills (including interpersonal skills) to design, plan and deliver physical activity sessions (including active play sessions) that meet children and young people s different needs and abilities. Those leading activities should make them enjoyable. The leaders should also be inspiring. They should raise children and young people s aspirations about what they can participate in \u2013 and the level of ability they can achieve. In addition, leaders should help foster children and young people s personal development.Use community networks and partnerships to encourage, develop and support local communities and volunteers involved in providing physical activities for children and young people. For recommendations on the principles of networking and partnership working, see NICE s recommendations on community engagement. Employers should provide regular and relevant development opportunities for employees and volunteers. The impact on practitioner performance and on children and young people s experiences should be monitored.subhead:Multi-component school and community programmesIdentify education institutions willing to deliver multi-component physical activity programmes involving school, family and community-based activities. Identify families, community members, groups and organisations and private sector organisations willing to contribute.Develop multi-component physical activity programmes. These should include: education and advice to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to give children and young people the confidence and motivation to get involved policy and environmental changes, such as creating a more supportive school environment and new opportunities for physical activity during breaks and after school the family: by providing homework activities which children and their parents or carers can do together, or advice on how to create a supportive home environment.

The aim is to develop their risk awareness and an understanding of their own abilities as necessary life skills.Ensure children have the opportunity to explore a range of physical activities to help them identify those they can enjoy by themselves and those they can do with friends and family.Provide daily opportunities for participation in physically active play by providing guidance and support, equipment and facilities. Keep children motivated to be physically active by updating and varying the way physical activities are delivered (including the resources and environments used).Ensure opportunities are available after school, at weekends, during half-term breaks and during the longer school holidays. Activities should be led by appropriately trained and qualified staff (paid or voluntary) and take place in schools and other community settings.subhead:Supporting girls and young womenConsult with girls and young women to find out what type of physical activities they prefer.

It should be practical, affordable and acceptable to them, without compromising their safety or restricting participation.Provide appropriate role models.subhead:Helping families to be activeEnsure parents and carers are aware of government advice that children and young people should undertake a minimum of 60 minutes moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. Make them aware that, at least twice a week, this should include activities to improve bone health, muscle strength and flexibility.Provide information and advice on the benefits of physical activity, emphasising how enjoyable it is. Provide examples of local opportunities.Encourage parents and carers to get involved in physical activities with their children.Encourage parents and carers to complete at least some local journeys (or some part of a local journey) with young children using a physically active mode of travel. This should take place on most days of the week. The aim is to establish physically active travel (such as walking or cycling) as a life-long habit from an early age. Parents and carers should also be encouraged to allow their children to become more independent, by gradually allowing them to walk, cycle or use another physically active mode of travel for short distances.Act as a role model by incorporating physical activity into daily life. For example, opt for travel involving physical activity (such as walking or cycling), use the stairs and regularly participate in recreational activities or sport.Promote physically active travel as an option for all the family.

Stop smoking advisers and other healthcare practitioners who advise on, supply, or prescribe, pharmacotherapies.subhead:What action should they take?Advise people who smoke that licensed nicotine-containing products and other stop smoking pharmacotherapies help people to stop smoking and reduce cravings. Emphasise that nicotine is not the major cause of damage to people s health from smoking tobacco, and that any risks from using licensed nicotine-containing products or other stop smoking pharmacotherapies are much lower than those of smoking.Recommend and offer: licensed nicotine-containing products (usually a combination of transdermal patches with a fast-acting product such as an inhalator, gum, lozenges or spray) to all people who smoke or varenicline (see what NICE says on varenicline) or bupropion as sole therapy as appropriate. Do not offer varenicline or bupropion to pregnant or breastfeeding women or people under the age of 18. Varenicline and bupropion can be used with caution in people with mental health problems (see the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) for varenicline and bupropion on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website for further information).Ideally, pregnant or breastfeeding women should stop smoking without using licensed nicotine-containing products, but if this is not possible, these products may be used.  For further information, see the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) for the individual drugs on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website.Encourage people who do not want (or do not feel able) to stop smoking completely (including pregnant or breastfeeding women) to use licensed nicotine-containing products to help reduce cravings to smoke during their stay or visit.If stop smoking pharmacotherapy is accepted, ensure that it is provided immediately. The person should remove nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches 24 hours before microvascular reconstructive surgery and surgery using vasopressin injections. When people are discharged from hospital ensure they have sufficient stop smoking pharmacotherapy to last at least 1 week or until their next contact with a stop smoking service. Encourage people who are already using an unlicensed nicotine-containing product (such as unlicensed electronic cigarettes) to switch to a licensed productAt the time of publication (November 2013), nicotine replacement therapy products were the only licensed nicotine-containing products. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has decided that all nicotine-containing products should be regulated once the European Commission s revised Tobacco Products Directive comes into effect in the UK (this is expected to be in 2016). In the meantime, the UK government will encourage applications for medicines licences for nicotine-containing products and will make best use of the flexibilities within the existing framework to enable licensed products to be available. This means that there may be both licensed and unlicensed products available until that date. For further details, see the MHRA website.. Advise the person of local policies on indoor and outdoor use of unlicensed nicotine-containing products.See also NICE s recommendations on smoking.subhead:VareniclineThese following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on varenicline for smoking cessation.Varenicline is recommended within its licensed indications as an option for smokers who have expressed a desire to quit smoking.Varenicline should normally be prescribed only as part of a programme of behavioural support.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on varenicline.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Smoking cessation: supporting people to stop smoking1Identifying people who smoke2Referral to smoking cessation services3Behavioural support with pharmacotherapy4PharmacotherapySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If they smoke but are not at the meeting, ask the pregnant woman to suggest they contact evidence-based stop-smoking services and provide her with contact details (for example, telephone and address card).Provide the woman with intensive and ongoing support (brief interventions alone are unlikely to be sufficient) throughout pregnancy and beyond. This includes regularly monitoring her smoking status using CO tests. The latter may encourage her to try to quit \u2013 and can also be a useful way of providing positive feedback once a quit attempt has been made.Biochemically validate that the woman has quit on the date she set and 4 weeks after. Where possible, use urine or saliva cotinine tests, as these are more accurate than CO tests and can detect exposure over the past few days rather than hours. When carrying out these tests, check whether the woman is using NRT as this may raise her cotinine levels. Note: no measure can be 100% accurate. Some people may smoke so infrequently \u2013 or inhale so little \u2013 that their intakes cannot reliably be distinguished from that due to passive smoking.If the woman says that she has stopped smoking, but the CO test reading is higher than 10 ppm, advise her about possible CO poisoning and ask her to call the free Health and Safety Executive gas safety advice line on: 0800 300 363. However, it is more likely that she is still smoking and any further questions must be phrased sensitively to encourage a frank discussion.If she stopped smoking in the 2 weeks prior to her maternity booking appointment, continue to provide support, in line with the recommendations above and evidence-based stop-smoking services practice protocols.Record the method used to quit smoking, including whether or not she received help and support. Follow up 12 months after the date she set to quit.Establish links with contraceptive services, fertility clinics and ante- and postnatal services so that everyone working in those organisations knows about local evidence-based stop-smoking services. Ensure they understand what these services offer and how to refer people to them.ContextStudies have shown that the following interventions are effective in helping women who are pregnant to quit smoking: cognitive behaviour therapy motivational interviewing structured self-help and support from evidence-based stop-smoking services.In addition, in other countries the provision of incentives to quit has been shown to be effective with this group (research is required to see whether it would work in the UK).Interventions using a  stages of change  approach have had mixed success. (In some studies the approach was effective; in others it was no better than the control.) Giving pregnant women feedback on the effects of smoking on the unborn child and on their own health (such as reports of urinary cotinine levels) is not effective.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Smoking: supporting people to stop3Behavioural support with pharmacotherapy5Outcome measurementSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

That is why it is important, when necessary, to help women lose weight before they become pregnant. Dieting during pregnancy is not recommended as it may harm the health of the unborn child. Many pregnant women ask health professionals for advice on what constitutes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. However, there are no evidence-based UK guidelines on recommended weight-gain ranges during pregnancy. The amount of weight a woman may gain in pregnancy can vary a great deal. Only some of it is due to increased body fat \u2013 the unborn child, placenta, amniotic fluid and increases in maternal blood and fluid volume all contribute.What action should be taken?At the earliest opportunity, for example, during a pregnant woman s first visit to a health professional, discuss her eating habits and how physically active she is. Find out if she has any concerns about diet and the amount of physical activity she does and try to address them.Advise that a healthy diet and being physically active will benefit both the woman and her unborn child during pregnancy and will also help her to achieve a healthy weight after giving birth. Advise her to seek information and advice on diet and activity from a reputable sourceReputable sources of information and advice about diet and physical activity for women before, during and after pregnancy include:  The pregnancy book  (Department of Health (2009) The pregnancy book. London: Department of Health),  Birth to five  (Department of Health (2009) Birth to five. London: Department of Health) and the  Eat well guide . .Offer practical and tailored information. This includes advice on how to use Healthy Start vouchers to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of those eligible for the Healthy Start scheme (women under 18 years and those who are receiving benefit payments).Dispel any myths about what and how much to eat during pregnancy. For example, advise that there is no need to  eat for two  or to drink full-fat milk. Explain that energy needs do not change in the first 6 months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last 3 months (and then only by around 200 calories per day).Advise that moderate-intensity physical activity will not harm her or her unborn child. At least 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity activity is recommended. Give specific and practical advice about being physically active during pregnancy (see the RCOG advice on physical activity):  recreational exercise such as swimming or brisk walking and strength conditioning exercise is safe and beneficial  the aim of recreational exercise is to stay fit, rather than to reach peak fitness  if women have not exercised routinely they should begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise, three times per week, increasing gradually to daily 30-minute sessionsThe NICE guideline on obesity prevention (CG43) recommends adults should be encouraged to do at least 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. The activity can be in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. if women exercised regularly before pregnancy, they should be able to continue with no adverse effects.Explain to those women who would find this level of physical activity difficult that it is important not to be sedentary, as far as possible. Encourage them to start walking and to build physical activity into daily life, for example, by taking the stairs instead of the lift, rather than sitting for long periods. Measure weight and height at the first contact with the pregnant woman, being sensitive to any concerns she may have about her weight. If these data are not available at their first booking appointment, then the midwife should do this. Do not rely on self-reported measures of weight and height. Clearly explain why this information is needed and how it will be used to plan her care. Weigh her in light clothing using appropriate, calibrated weighing scales that are regularly checked. Calculate BMI by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m2), or use the BMI calculator after measuring and weighing. Use BMI percentile charts for pregnant women under 18 years, as a BMI measure alone does not take growth into account and is inappropriate for this age group.Weight, height and BMI should be recorded in notes, the woman s hand-held record and the patient information system. If a hand-held record is not available, use local protocols to record this information.Do not weigh women repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. Only weigh again if clinical management can be influenced or if nutrition is a concern.subhead:Supporting women after childbirthUse the 6\u20138-week postnatal check as an opportunity to discuss the woman s weight. Ask those who are overweight, obese or who have concerns about their weight if they would like any further advice and support now \u2013 or later. If they say they would like help later, they should be asked whether they would like to make an appointment within the next 6 months for advice and support.During the 6\u20138-week postnatal check, or during the follow-up appointment within the next 6 months, provide clear, tailored, consistent, up-to-date and timely advice about how to lose weight safely after childbirth. Ensure women have a realistic expectation of the time it will take to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Discuss the benefits of a healthy diet and regular physical activity, acknowledging the woman s role within the family and how she can be supported by her partner and wider family. Advice on healthy eating and physical activity should be tailored to her circumstances. For example, it should take into account the demands of caring for a baby and any other children, how tired she is and any health problems she may have (such as pelvic floor muscle weakness or backache).Health professionals should advise women, their partners and family to seek information and advice from a reputable source. Women who want support to lose weight should be given details of appropriate community-based services.See also what NICE says on physical activity.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Further weight loss, to achieve a BMI within the healthy range (between 24.9 and 18.5 kg/m2) should also be encouraged, using evidence-based behaviour change techniques. Losing weight to within this range may be difficult and women will need to be motivated and supported.Health professionals should encourage women to check their weight and waist measurement periodically or, as a simple alternative, check the fit of their clothes. Health professionals should offer a weight loss support programme involving diet and physical activity. The programme should follow the principles of good practice, as outlined in self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes.Health professionals should offer specific dietary advice in preparation for pregnancy, including the need to take daily folic acid supplements. This includes professionals working in pre-conception clinics, fertility clinics, sexual and reproductive health services and children s centres.Explain to women with a booking appointment BMI of 30 or more how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child.

Breastfeeding progress should then be assessed and documented in the postnatal care plan at each contact.If an insufficiency of milk is perceived by the woman, attachment and positioning should be reviewed and her baby s health should be evaluated. Reassurance should be offered to support the woman to gain confidence in her ability to produce enough milk for her baby.If the baby is not taking sufficient milk directly from the breast and supplementary feeds are necessary, expressed breast milk should be given by a cup or bottle.Supplementation with fluids other than breast milk is not recommended.subhead:Ankyloglossia (tongue-tie)Evaluation for ankyloglossia should be made if breastfeeding concerns persist after a review of positioning and attachment by a skilled healthcare professional or peer counsellor.Babies who appear to have ankyloglossia should be evaluated further (non-urgent action).Division of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) for breastfeedingNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on division of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) for breastfeeding with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Postnatal care1Continuity of careSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
