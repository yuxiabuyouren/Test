of lung cancer, through coordinated campaigning to raise awareness.Rapid access clinics (previously known as early diagnosis clinics) should be provided where possible for the investigation of patients with suspected lung cancer, because they are associated with faster diagnosis and less patient anxiety.All cancer units/centres should have one or more trained lung cancer clinical nurse specialists to see patients before and after diagnosis, to provide continuing support, and to facilitate communication between the secondary care team (including the MDT), the patient s GP, the community team and the patient. Their role includes helping patients to access advice and support whenever they need it.Every cancer network should have a system of rapid access to PET-CT scanning for eligible patients.Every cancer network should have at least one centre with EBUS and/or EUS to ensure timely access.Every cancer network should ensure that patients have rapid access to a team capable of providing interventional endobronchial treatments.

Companies should provide advice about the performance characteristics of the assays to laboratories, and ensure standardisation of results. Commissioning groups adopting the OC Sensor, HM-JACKarc and FOB Gold should audit their outcomes and monitor the associated resource use (see section 6.1).There is currently not enough evidence to recommend the routine adoption of the RIDASCREEN haemoglobin or the RIDASCREEN haemoglobin/haptoglobin assay in primary care to guide referral for suspected colorectal cancer in people without rectal bleeding who have unexplained symptoms but do not meet the criteria for a suspected cancer pathway referral outlined above.subhead:Anal cancerConsider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for anal cancer in people with an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration.

Responders should be assessed at intervals of approximately 12 weeks thereafter. Continuation of treatment is recommended at 400 mg/day until the tumour ceases to respond. An increase in the dose of imatinib is not recommended for people receiving imatinib who develop progressive disease after initially responding.The use of imatinib should be supervised by cancer specialists with experience in the management of people with unresectable and/or metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumours.NICE has written information for the public on imatinib for unresectable and/or metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumours.subhead:High-dose imatinib The following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on imatinib for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours.Imatinib at 600 or 800 mg/day is not recommended for people with unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours whose disease has progressed after treatment with 400 mg/day imatinib.People who are currently receiving 600 or 800 mg/day imatinib for unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours should have the option to continue therapy until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.

NICE looked at SonoVue when it is used with ultrasound to look at the liver. It can give doctors more information about abnormal-looking areas in the liver than normal ultrasound, which can help with the diagnosis.NICE has said that SonoVue is recommended for use with ultrasound for examining abnormal-looking areas in the liver that are noticed, but cannot be properly identified, using normal ultrasound. These areas may have been noticed during routine scanning. If they were noticed when looking for cancer that has spread from another part of the body, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want a CT (computed tomography) scan. If they were noticed in someone with cirrhosis who is having their liver checked, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.6InvestigationsSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Step 2 If the MLH1 immunohistochemistry result is abnormal, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test.  If the MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 immunohistochemistry results are abnormal, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  If using microsatellite instability testing, follow the steps in table 2.Table 2 Steps in the microsatellite instability testing strategyStep 1 Do a microsatellite instability test. Step 2 If the microsatellite instability test result is positive, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  Healthcare professionals should ensure that people are informed of the possible implications of test results for both themselves and their relatives, and ensure that relevant support and information is available. Discussion of genetic testing should be done by a healthcare professional with appropriate training.Laboratories doing microsatellite instability testing or immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins should take part in a recognised external quality assurance programme.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1ColonoscopySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

For patients with borderline fitness and smaller tumours(T1a\u2013b, N0, M0), consider lung parenchymal-sparing operations (segmentectomy or wedge resection) if a complete resection can be achieved.Offer more extensive surgery (bronchoangioplastic surgery, bilobectomy, pneumonectomy) only when needed to obtain clear margins.Perform hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling or en bloc resection for all patients undergoing surgery with curative intent.For patients with T3 NSCLC with chest wall involvement who are undergoing surgery, complete resection of the tumour should be the aim by either extrapleural or en bloc chest wall resection.For patients with NSCLC who are suitable for surgery, do not offer neo-adjuvant chemotherapy outside a clinical trial. subhead:Thopaz+ for managing chest drainsThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on Thopaz+ portable digital system for managing chest drains.The case for adopting Thopaz+ for managing chest drains is supported by the evidence. Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay.  The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.subhead: Depth of anaesthesia  monitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on depth of anaesthesia monitors \u2013 Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M. The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.For further information, see what NICE says on preoperative tests.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance: cryotherapy for malignant endobronchial obstruction  photodynamic therapy for advanced bronchial carcinoma.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.8Curative treatment in people of borderline fitnessSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

These treatments have the advantage of reducing the risk of damage to normal tissue (estimated by using measurements such as V20)..Offer patients with stage I\u2013III NSCLC who are not suitable for surgery an assessment by a clinical oncologist specialising in thoracic oncology for radiotherapy with curative intent.All patients should undergo pulmonary function tests (including lung volumes and transfer factor) before having radical radiotherapy for NSCLC. Patients who have poor lung function but are otherwise suitable for radical radiotherapy should still be offered radiotherapy, provided the volume of irradiated lung is small. Patients with stage I or II NSCLC who are medically inoperable but suitable for radical radiotherapy should be offered the CHART regimen. Patients with stages IIIA or IIIB NSCLC who are eligible for radical radiotherapy and who cannot tolerate or do not wish to have chemoradiotherapy should be offered the CHART regimen.

This practical resource is for primary care professionals (it is not formal NICE guidance).The recommendations in this guidance on diagnostic investigations refer to people whose condition is being managed in secondary care. Advise the patient that more than one investigation may be necessary to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Offer colonoscopy to patients without major comorbidity, to confirm a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected, perform a biopsy to obtain histological proof of diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated (for example, patients with a blood clotting disorder). Offer flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema for patients with major comorbidity. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected perform a biopsy unless it is contraindicated. Consider computed tomographic (CT) colonography as an alternative to colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema, if the local radiology service can demonstrate competency in this technique. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected on CT colonography, offer a colonoscopy with biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, unless it is contraindicated. Offer patients who have had an incomplete colonoscopy: repeat colonoscopy or CT colonography, if the local radiology service can demonstrate competency in this technique or  barium enema. subhead:Virtual chromoendoscopy to assess colorectal polyps during colonoscopyThe following recommendation is from NICE diagnostics guidance on virtual chromoendoscopy to assess colorectal polyps during colonoscopy.Virtual chromoendoscopy using NBI, FICE or i-scan is recommended to assess polyps of 5 mm or less during colonoscopy, instead of histopathology, to determine whether they are adenomatous or hyperplastic, only if: high-definition enabled virtual chromoendoscopy equipment is used the endoscopist has been trained to use virtual chromoendoscopy, and accredited to use the technique under a national accreditation scheme the endoscopy service includes systems to audit endoscopists and provide ongoing feedback on their performance (see section 6.1 of NICE diagnostics guidance 28) and the assessment is made with high confidence.subhead:Molecular testing strategies for Lynch syndromeThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on molecular testing strategies for Lynch syndrome in people with colorectal cancer.Offer testing to all people with colorectal cancer, when first diagnosed, using immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins or microsatellite instability testing to identify tumours with deficient DNA mismatch repair, and to guide further sequential testing for Lynch syndrome (see recommendations below). Do not wait for the results before starting treatment.If using immunohistochemistry, follow the steps in table 1.Table 1 Steps in the immunohistochemistry testing strategyStep 1 Do an immunohistochemistry 4-panel test for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Step 2 If the MLH1 immunohistochemistry result is abnormal, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test.  If the MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 immunohistochemistry results are abnormal, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  If using microsatellite instability testing, follow the steps in table 2.Table 2 Steps in the microsatellite instability testing strategyStep 1 Do a microsatellite instability test. Step 2 If the microsatellite instability test result is positive, use sequential BRAF V600E and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing to differentiate sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers. First do a BRAF V600E test. Step 3 If the BRAF V600E test is negative, do an MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test. Step 4 If the MLH1 promoter hypermethylation test is negative, confirm Lynch syndrome by genetic testing of germline DNA.  Healthcare professionals should ensure that people are informed of the possible implications of test results for both themselves and their relatives, and ensure that relevant support and information is available. Discussion of genetic testing should be done by a healthcare professional with appropriate training.Laboratories doing microsatellite instability testing or immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins should take part in a recognised external quality assurance programme.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1ColonoscopySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

The exact criteria to be used should be determined by the relevant national professional bodies. Cancer networks and constituent trusts should ensure that any local laparoscopic colorectal surgical practice meets these criteria as part of their clinical governance arrangements.The decision about which of the procedures (open or laparoscopic) is undertaken should be made after informed discussion between the patient and the surgeon. In particular, they should consider:  the suitability of the lesion for laparoscopic resection  the risks and benefits of the two procedures the experience of the surgeon in both procedures.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on laparoscopic surgery.subhead:Information about stomasBefore surgery, offer all patients information about the likelihood of having a stoma, why it might be necessary, and how long it might be needed for. Ensure a trained stoma professional gives specific information on the care and management of stomas to all patients considering surgery that might result in a stoma. subhead:CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitorThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on CardioQ-ODM oesophageal doppler monitor. The case for adopting the CardioQ-ODM in the NHS, when used as described below, is supported by the evidence. There is a reduction in post-operative complications, use of central venous catheters and in-hospital stay (with no increase in the rate of re-admission or repeat surgery) compared with conventional clinical assessment with or without invasive cardiovascular monitoring. The cost saving per patient, when the CardioQ-ODM is used instead of a central venous catheter in the peri-operative period, is about \u00a31,100 based on a 7.5-day hospital stay.The CardioQ-ODM should be considered for use in patients undergoing major or high-risk surgery or other surgical patients in whom a clinician would consider using invasive cardiovascular monitoring.subhead:Transanal total mesorectal excision of the rectumNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on transanal total mesorectal excision of the rectum with   special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.See also what NICE says on preoperative tests.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Consider substituting carboplatin in patients with impaired renal function, poor performance status (WHO 2 or more) or significant comorbidity.Offer concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with limited-stage disease SCLC (broadly corresponding to T1\u20134, N0\u20133, M0) and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1 if they present with disease that can be encompassed in a radical thoracic radiotherapy volume. Start the radiotherapy during the first or second cycle of chemotherapy.Offer sequential radical radiotherapy to patients with limited-stage disease SCLC (broadly corresponding to T1\u20134,  N0\u20133, M0) who are unfit for concurrent chemoradiotherapy but who respond to chemotherapy.subhead:Extensive disease (broadly T1\u20134, N0\u20133, M1a/b)Offer platinum-based combination chemotherapy to patients with extensive-stage disease SCLC (broadly corresponding to T1\u20134, N0\u20133, M1a/b \u2013 including cerebral metastases) if they are fit enough.Assess the patient s condition before each cycle of chemotherapy for extensive-stage disease SCLC (broadly corresponding to T1\u20134, N0\u20133, M1a/b) and offer up to a maximum of six cycles, depending on response and toxicity.For patients with extensive-stage disease SCLC, thoracic radiotherapy should be considered after chemotherapy if there has been a complete response at distant sites and at least a good partial response within the thorax.subhead:Thopaz+ for managing chest drainsThe following recommendations are from NICE medical technologies guidance on Thopaz+ portable digital system for managing chest drains.The case for adopting Thopaz+ for managing chest drains is supported by the evidence. Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

If intracranial disease is suspected, offer contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain. Do not offer imaging of the head, neck and limbs unless involvement of these sites is suspected clinically. Discuss all imaging with the patient following review by the appropriate anatomical site-specific multidisciplinary team. If the CT scan shows the patient may have extrahepatic metastases that could be amenable to further radical surgery, an anatomical site-specific multidisciplinary team should decide whether a PET-CT scan of the whole body is appropriate. If contrast-enhanced CT suggests disease in the pelvis, offer an MRI of the pelvis and discuss in the colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team.
