A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner (see investigation of fertility problems and management strategies). A woman of reproductive age who is using artificial insemination to conceive (with either partner or donor sperm) should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation if she has not conceived after 6 cycles of treatment, in the absence of any known cause of infertility. Where this is using partner sperm, the referral for clinical assessment and investigation should include her partner (see investigation of fertility problems and management strategies). Offer an earlier referral for specialist consultation to discuss the options for attempting conception, further assessment and appropriate treatment where: the woman is 36 years or over there is a known clinical cause of infertility or a history of predisposing factors for infertility. Where treatment is planned that may result in infertility (such as treatment for cancer), early fertility specialist referral should be offered. People who are concerned about their fertility and who are known to have chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV should be referred to centres that have appropriate expertise and facilities to provide safe risk-reduction investigation and treatment.
