Avoid missing meals or leaving long gaps between eating. Drink at least 8 cups of fluid per day, especially water or other non-caffeinated drinks such as herbal teas. Restrict tea and coffee to 3 cups per day. Reduce intake of alcohol and fizzy drinks. Consider limiting intake of high-fibre food (for example, wholemeal or high-fibre flour and breads, cereals high in bran, and whole grains such as brown rice). Reduce intake of  resistant starch  (starch that resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon intact), often found in processed or re-cooked foods. Limit fresh fruit to 3 portions (of 80 g each) per day. For diarrhoea, avoid sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in sugar-free sweets (including chewing gum) and drinks, and in some diabetic and slimming products. For wind and bloating consider increasing intake of oats (for example, oat-based breakfast cereal or porridge) and linseeds (up to 1 tablespoon per day).Review the person s fibre intake and adjust (usually reduce) according to symptoms. Discourage intake of insoluble fibre (for example, bran). If more fibre is needed, recommend soluble fibre such as ispaghula powder, or foods high in soluble fibre (for example, oats).If the person wants to try probiotics, advise them to take the dose recommended by the manufacturer for at least 4 weeks while monitoring the effect.Discourage use of aloe vera for IBS.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether SeHCAT is a cost-effective option for diagnosing bile acid malabsorption in people with IBS-D and people with Crohn s disease without ileal resection. Therefore, for people with these conditions, SeHCAT is recommended for use in research to collect evidence about its clinical benefits and risks and the acceptability associated with diagnosing and treating bile acid malabsorption.Quality standardsThe following quality statements are relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Irritable bowel syndrome in adults1Excluding inflammatory causes2Giving a diagnosisThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.Coeliac disease1Serological testing for coeliac diseaseSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
