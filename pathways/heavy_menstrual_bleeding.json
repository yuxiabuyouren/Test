The operative competence of healthcare professionals who are acquiring new skills in procedures to diagnose and treat heavy menstrual bleeding should be formally assessed by trainers through a structured process such as that defined within training schemes of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board, the Royal Colleges and/or the Society and College. Training programmes must be long enough to enable healthcare professionals to achieve competency in complex procedures when these are appropriate (for example, operations for fibroids that are large or in an awkward position, or using laparoscopic techniques). These training programmes will usually be located in units with a particular interest and sufficient workload to allow experience of these procedures.subhead:Maintenance Maintenance of surgical, imaging or radiological skills requires a robust clinical governance framework including audit of numbers, decision making, case-mix issues and outcomes of all treatments at both individual operator and organisational levels. These data should be used to demonstrate good clinical practice. Established healthcare professionals should be able to demonstrate that their training, experience and current practice meets or exceeds the standards laid out for newly trained professionals. subhead:Governance If a healthcare professional lacks competence to undertake a procedure then they should refer the woman to a professional with the appropriate skill. Organisations that commission services should be responsible (through service specification based on robust audit data) for identifying and contracting professionals with appropriate skills.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Any interventions should aim to improve quality of life measures.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
