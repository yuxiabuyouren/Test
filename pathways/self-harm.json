Within the bounds of patient confidentiality, and subject to the patient s consent, staff should attempt to obtain relevant information from relatives, friends, carers and other key people, to inform the assessment. In the assessment and treatment of people who have self-harmed, mental capacity should be assumed unless there is evidence to the contrary. Staff should provide full information about the treatment options, and make all efforts necessary to ensure that someone who has self-harmed can give, and has the opportunity to give, meaningful and informed consent before any and each procedure (for example, taking the person to hospital by ambulance) or treatment is initiated.If a person is assessed as being mentally incapable, staff have a responsibility, under common law, to act in that person s best interests. If necessary, this can include taking the person to hospital, and detaining them to allow assessment and treatment against the person s stated wishes.Staff should take into account that a person s capacity to make informed decisions may change over time. Whether it has been possible to obtain consent or not, attempts should be made to explain each new treatment or procedure and obtain consent before it is initiated. Staff working with people who self-harm should understand when and how the Mental Health Act can be used to treat the physical consequences of self-harm. Staff working with people who self-harm should have easy access to legal advice about issues relating to capacity and consent at all times.

Clinical and non-clinical staff who have contact with people who self-harm in any setting should be provided with appropriate training to equip them to understand and care for people who have self-harmed. People who self-harm should be involved in the planning and delivery of training for staff. Providing treatment and care for people who have self-harmed is emotionally demanding and requires a high level of communication skills and support. All staff undertaking this work should have regular clinical supervision in which the emotional impact upon staff members can be discussed and understood. subhead:Staff working with under 18s Staff who have emergency contact with children and young people who have self-harmed should be adequately trained to assess mental capacity in children of different ages and to understand how issues of mental capacity and consent apply to this group.

In addition, healthcare professionals should take full account of the likely distress associated with self-harm. Wherever possible, people who have self-harmed should be offered the choice of male or female staff for both assessment and treatment. When this is not possible, the reasons should be explained to the service user and written in their notes. When assessing people who self-harm, healthcare professionals should ask service users to explain their feelings and understanding of their own self-harm in their own words.When caring for people who repeatedly self-harm, healthcare professionals should be aware that the individual s reasons for self-harming may be different on each occasion and therefore each episode needs to be treated in its own right. Healthcare professionals should involve people who self-harm in all discussions and decision-making about their treatment and subsequent care. To do this, staff should provide people who self-harm with full information about the different treatment options available. People who have self-harmed should be offered treatment for the physical consequences of self-harm, regardless of their willingness to accept psychosocial assessment or psychiatric treatment.Ensure that people who self-harm, and their families, carers and significant others where this is agreed with the person, have access to information for the public on self-harm: short-term treatment and management.subhead:Special considerations for over 65sAll people older than 65 years of age who have self-harmed should be assessed by mental healthcare practitioners experienced in the assessment of older people who self-harm. Assessment should follow the same principles as for younger adults who self-harm, but should also pay particular attention to the potential presence of depression, cognitive impairment and physical ill health, and should include a full assessment of their social and home situation.All acts of self-harm in people older than 65 years of age should be regarded as evidence of suicidal intent until proven otherwise because the number of people in this age range who go on to complete suicide is much higher than in younger adults.Given the high risks amongst older adults who have self-harmed, consideration should be given to admission for mental health risk and needs assessment, and time given to monitor changes in mental state and levels of risk.In all other respects, the assessment and treatment of older adults who have self-harmed should follow the recommendations given for adults.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.1Compassion, respect and dignitySourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Continue treatment in CAMHS beyond 18 years if there is a realistic possibility that this may avoid the need for referral to adult mental health services.
