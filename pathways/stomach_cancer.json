Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see referral and safety netting) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information.  When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist. If the person has additional support needs because of their personal circumstances, inform the specialist (with the person s agreement).

NICE looked at SonoVue when it is used with ultrasound to look at the liver. It can give doctors more information about abnormal-looking areas in the liver than normal ultrasound, which can help with the diagnosis.NICE has said that SonoVue is recommended for use with ultrasound for examining abnormal-looking areas in the liver that are noticed, but cannot be properly identified, using normal ultrasound. These areas may have been noticed during routine scanning. If they were noticed when looking for cancer that has spread from another part of the body, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want a CT (computed tomography) scan. If they were noticed in someone with cirrhosis who is having their liver checked, SonoVue is recommended if the person cannot have or does not want an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.6InvestigationsSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay.  The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.subhead: Depth of anaesthesia  monitorsThe following recommendations are from NICE diagnostics guidance on depth of anaesthesia monitors \u2013 Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M. The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is recommended as an option during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The BIS depth of anaesthesia monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.The use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors is also recommended as an option in all patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia. The BIS monitor is therefore recommended as an option in these patients.Although there is greater uncertainty of clinical benefit for the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M depth of anaesthesia monitors than for the BIS monitor, the Committee concluded that the E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are broadly equivalent to BIS. These monitors are therefore recommended as options during any type of general anaesthesia in patients considered at higher risk of adverse outcomes. This includes patients at higher risk of unintended awareness and patients at higher risk of excessively deep anaesthesia. The E-Entropy and Narcotrend-Compact M monitors are also recommended as options in patients receiving total intravenous anaesthesia.Anaesthetists using EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors should have appropriate training and experience with these monitors and understand the potential limitations of their use in clinical practice.For further information, see what NICE says on preoperative tests.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on End-tidal Control software for use with Aisys closed circuit anaesthesia systems for automated gas control during general anaesthesia.subhead:Interventional proceduresNICE has published guidance on the following procedures with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance: cryotherapy for malignant endobronchial obstruction  photodynamic therapy for advanced bronchial carcinoma.Quality standardsThe following quality statement is relevant to this part of the interactive flowchart.8Curative treatment in people of borderline fitnessSourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.Thopaz+ should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax. The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable. Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains.Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is \u00a3111 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay. The NICE resource impact assessment shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around \u00a38.5 million per year in England.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical.  Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary.  Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent.  Use local referral proformas if these are in use.  Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day.  Persistent parental concern and anxietyTake into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child s symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. Waiting periods and missed appointmentsPut in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements.  Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up.  subhead:Safety nettingSafety netting is the active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects: timely review and action after investigations active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be: planned within a time frame agreed with the person or patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
