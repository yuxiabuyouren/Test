Bedwetting every night Severe bedwetting, which is less likely to resolve spontaneously than infrequent bedwetting. Previously dry for more than 6 months Bedwetting is defined as secondary.  Daytime frequency Daytime urgency Daytime wetting Abdominal straining or poor urinary stream Pain passing urine Any of these may indicate the presence of a bladder disorder such as overactive bladder or more rarely (when symptoms are very severe and persistent) an underlying urological disease. Constipation A common comorbidity that can cause bedwetting and requires treatment (see what NICE says on constipation in children and young people). Soiling Frequent soiling is usually secondary to underlying faecal impaction and constipation which may have been unrecognised. Inadequate fluid intake May mask an underlying bladder problem, such as overactive bladder disorder, and may impede the development of an adequate bladder capacity. Behavioural and emotional problems These may be a cause or a consequence of bedwetting. Treatment may need to be tailored to the specific requirements of each child or young person and family. Family problems A difficult or  stressful  environment may be a trigger for bedwetting. These factors should be addressed alongside the management of bedwetting.
