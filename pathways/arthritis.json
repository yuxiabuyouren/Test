This will start after a review by the MHRA of the safety of over-the-counter analgesics is completed. For more information, see the NICE guideline on osteoarthritis.In the meantime, the recommendations below remain current advice. However, the GDG would like to draw attention to the findings of the evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol that was presented in the consultation version of the osteoarthritis guideline. That review identified reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what was previously thought. The GDG believes that this information should be taken into account in routine prescribing practice until the planned full review of evidence on the pharmacological management of osteoarthritis is published See what NICE says on medicines optimisation.subhead:Oral analgesicsHealthcare professionals should consider offering paracetamol for pain relief in addition to core treatments; regular dosing may be required. Paracetamol and/or topical NSAIDs should be considered ahead of oral NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors or opioids.If paracetamol or topical NSAIDs are insufficient for pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, then the addition of opioid analgesics should be considered. Risks and benefits should be considered, particularly in older people.subhead:Topical treatmentsConsider topical NSAIDs for pain relief in addition to core treatments for people with knee or hand osteoarthritis. Consider topical NSAIDs and/or paracetamol ahead of oral NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors or opioids.Topical capsaicin should be considered as an adjunct to core treatments for knee or hand osteoarthritis.Do not offer rubefacients for treating osteoarthritis.NICE has published a medtech innovation briefing on FLEXISEQ for osteoarthritis.subhead:NSAIDs and highly selective COX-2 inhibitorsAlthough NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors may be regarded as a single drug class of  NSAIDs , these recommendations use the two terms for clarity and because of the differences in side-effect profile. Where paracetamol or topical NSAIDs are ineffective for pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, then substitution with an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor should be considered.Where paracetamol or topical NSAIDs provide insufficient pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, then the addition of an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor to paracetamol should be considered.Use oral NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period of time.When offering treatment with an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor, the first choice should be either a standard NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor (other than etoricoxib 60 mg). In either case, co-prescribe with a PPI, choosing the one with the lowest acquisition cost.All oral NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude but vary in their potential gastrointestinal, liver and cardio-renal toxicity; therefore, when choosing the agent and dose, take into account individual patient risk factors, including age. When prescribing these drugs, consideration should be given to appropriate assessment and/or ongoing monitoring of these risk factors.If a person with osteoarthritis needs to take low-dose aspirin, healthcare professionals should consider other analgesics before substituting or adding an NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor (with a PPI) if pain relief is ineffective or insufficient.subhead:Intra-articular injectionsIntra-articular corticosteroid injections should be considered as an adjunct to core treatments for the relief of moderate to severe pain in people with osteoarthritis.Do not offer intra-articular hyaluronan injections for the management of osteoarthritis.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

People whose disease has a PASI 75 response but whose PsARC response does not justify continuing treatment should be assessed by a dermatologist, to determine whether continuing treatment is appropriate based on skin response (as described in the NICE technology appraisal guidance on etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, recommendation 1.3).When using the PsARC healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities or communication difficulties that could affect a person s responses to components of the PsARC and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.This guidance is not intended to affect the position of patients whose treatment with certolizumab pegol and secukinumab was started within the NHS before this guidance was published. Treatment of those patients may continue without change to whatever funding arrangements were in place for them before this guidance was published until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on certolizumab pegol and secukinumab.subhead:Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumabThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab are recommended for the treatment of adults with active and progressive psoriatic arthritis when the following criteria are met. The person has peripheral arthritis with 3 or more tender joints and 3 or more swollen joints, and The psoriatic arthritis has not responded to adequate trials of at least 2 standard DMARDs, administered either individually or in combination.Treatment as described above should normally be started with the least expensive drug (taking into account drug administration costs, required dose and product price per dose). This may need to be varied for individual patients because of differences in the method of administration and treatment schedules.Etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab treatment should be discontinued in people whose psoriatic arthritis has not shown an adequate response using the PsARC at 12 weeks. An adequate response is defined as an improvement in at least 2 of the 4 PsARC criteria (1 of which has to be joint tenderness or swelling score), with no worsening in any of the 4 criteria. People whose disease has a PASI 75 response at 12 weeks but whose PsARC response does not justify continuation of treatment should be assessed by a dermatologist to determine whether continuing treatment is appropriate on the basis of skin response (see etanercept and efalizumab for the treatment of adults with psoriasis, infliximab for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and adalimumab for the treatment of adults with psoriasis for guidance on the use of TNF inhibitors in psoriasis).When using the PsARC healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect a person s responses to components of the PsARC and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. subhead:GolimumabThe following recommendations are from NICE technology appraisal guidance on golimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.Golimumab is recommended as an option for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults only if: it is used as described for other TNF inhibitor treatments in  Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab  above and the manufacturer provides the 100 mg dose of golimumab at the same cost as the 50 mg dose.When using the PsARC (as set out in  Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab  above), healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect a person s responses to components of the PsARC and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. subhead:UstekinumabThe following recommendations are from technology appraisal guidance on ustekinumab for treating active psoriatic arthritis. Ustekinumab is recommended as an option, alone or in combination with methotrexate, for treating active psoriatic arthritis in adults only when: treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors is contraindicated but would otherwise be considered (as described in  Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab  and  Golimumab  above) or the person has had treatment with 1 or more TNF-alpha inhibitors.Ustekinumab treatment should be stopped if the person s psoriatic arthritis has not shown an adequate response using the PsARC at 24 weeks. An adequate response is defined as an improvement in at least 2 of the 4 criteria (1 of which must be joint tenderness or swelling score), with no worsening in any of the 4 criteria. As recommended in  Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab  above, people whose disease has a PASI 75 response but whose PsARC response does not justify continuing treatment should be assessed by a dermatologist to determine whether continuing treatment is appropriate on the basis of skin response (see NICE technology appraisal guidance on ustekinumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe psoriasis).When using the PsARC healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect a person s responses to components of the PsARC and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.People whose treatment with ustekinumab is not recommended in this NICE guidance, but was started within the NHS before this guidance was published, should be able to continue ustekinumab until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.
