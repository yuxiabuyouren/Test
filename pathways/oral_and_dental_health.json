Consider using the oral health assessment tool. Where family and friends are involved in ongoing care, consider involving them in the initial assessment, with the resident s permission, if it will help staff understand the resident s usual oral hygiene routine. Ask:  How the resident usually manages their daily mouth care (for example, toothbrushing and type of toothbrush, removing and caring for dentures including partial dentures). Check whether they need support. If they have dentures, including partial dentures, whether they are marked or unmarked. If unmarked, ask whether they would like to arrange for marking and offer to help. The name and address of their dentist or any dental service they have had contact with, and where and how long ago they saw a dentist or received dental treatment. Record if there has been no contact or they do not have a dentist, and help them find one.Make an appointment for the resident to see a dental practitioner, if necessary.Record the results of the assessment and the appointment in the resident s personal care plan.Review and update residents  mouth care needs in their personal care plans as their mouth care needs change.Ensure care staff know how to recognise and respond to changes in a resident s mouth care needs.

If a supervised tooth brushing scheme is not feasible (see supervised tooth brushing schemes in this pathway), consider commissioning a community-based fluoride varnish programme for nurseries as part of early years services for children aged 3 years and older. The programme should provide at least 2 applications of fluoride varnish a year. Ensure early years services work in collaboration with parents and carers to gain parental consent for as many children as possible to take part in the fluoride varnish programme. Ensure families of children who do not visit the dentist regularly are encouraged and helped to use dental services.  Monitor uptake and seek parental feedback on the fluoride varnish scheme.

The practice of prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molars should be discontinued in the NHS.The standard routine programme of dental care by dental practitioners and/or paraprofessional staff, need be no different, in general, for pathology free impacted third molars (those requiring no additional investigations or procedures).Surgical removal of impacted third molars should be limited to patients with evidence of pathology. Such pathology includes unrestorable caries, non-treatable pulpal and/or periapical pathology, cellulitis, abscess and osteomyelitis, internal/external resorption of the tooth or adjacent teeth, fracture of tooth, disease of follicle including cyst/tumour, tooth/teeth impeding surgery or reconstructive jaw surgery, and when a tooth is involved in or within the field of tumour resection.Specific attention is drawn to plaque formation and pericoronitis. Plaque formation is a risk factor but is not in itself an indication for surgery. The degree to which the severity or recurrence rate of pericoronitis should influence the decision for surgical removal of a third molar remains unclear. The evidence suggests that a first episode of pericoronitis, unless particularly severe, should not be considered an indication for surgery. Second or subsequent episodes should be considered the appropriate indication for surgery.subhead:Mini/micro screw implantation for orthodontic anchorageNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on mini/micro screw implantation for orthodontic anchorage with normal arrangements for consent, audit and clinical governance.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.

This assessment should integrate the evidence presented in the guideline with the clinical judgement and expertise of the dental team, and should be discussed with the patient. Choose the interval before the next oral health review, either at the end of an oral health review if no further treatment is indicated, or on completion of a specific treatment journey. For practical reasons, the patient should be assigned a recall interval of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months if he or she is younger than 18 years old, or  3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 months if he or she is aged 18 years or older.Discuss the recommended recall interval with the patient and record this interval, and the patient s agreement or disagreement with it, in the current record-keeping system. subhead:Recommended shortest and longest intervals between oral health reviewsThe recommended shortest and longest intervals between oral health reviews are as follows.Shortest interval (all patients)The shortest interval between oral health reviews for all patients should be 3 months. A recall interval of less than 3 months is not normally needed for a routine dental recall. A patient may need to be seen more frequently for specific reasons such as disease management, ongoing courses of treatment, emergency dental interventions, or episodes of specialist care, which are outside the scope of an oral health review.Longest interval (younger than 18 years)The longest interval between oral health reviews for patients younger than 18 years should be 12 months.There is evidence that the rate of progression of dental caries can be more rapid in children and adolescents than in older people, and it seems to be faster in primary teeth than in permanent teeth. Periodic developmental assessment of the dentition is also required in children.Recall intervals of no longer than 12 months give the opportunity for delivering and reinforcing preventive advice and for raising awareness of the importance of good oral health. This is particularly important in young children, to lay the foundations for life-long dental health.Longest interval (older than 18 years)The longest interval between oral health reviews for patients aged 18 years and older should be 24 months. Recall intervals for patients who have repeatedly demonstrated that they can maintain oral health and who are not considered to be at risk of or from oral disease may be extended over time up to an interval of 24 months. Intervals of longer than 24 months are undesirable because they could diminish the professional relationship between dentist and patient, and people s lifestyles may change.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
