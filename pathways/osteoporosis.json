This guidance relates only to treatments for the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis and have sustained a clinically apparent osteoporotic fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of \u20132.5 SD or below on DXA scanning. However, the diagnosis may be assumed in women aged 75 years or older if the responsible clinician considers a DXA scan to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible.This guidance assumes that women who receive treatment have an adequate calcium intake and are vitamin D replete. Unless clinicians are confident that women who receive treatment meet these criteria, calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation should be considered.This guidance does not cover the following: The use of raloxifene or teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in women with normal BMD or osteopenia (that is, women with a T-score between \u20131 and \u20132.5 SD below peak BMD). The use of these drugs for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in women who are on long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment.Raloxifene is recommended as an alternative treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women: who are unable to comply with the special instructions for the administration of alendronate and risedronate, or have a contraindication to or are intolerant of alendronate and either risedronate (as defined in intolerance below) and who also have a combination of T-score, age and number of independent clinical risk factors for fracture (see independent clinical risk factors below) as indicated in the following table.T-scores (SD) at (or below) which raloxifene is recommended when alendronate and risedronate cannot be takenNumber of independent clinical risk factors for fracture Age (years) 0 1 2 50\u201354 \u2014a -3.5 -3.5 55\u201359 -4.0 -3.5 -3.5 60\u201364 -4.0 -3.5 -3.5 65\u201369 -4.0 -3.5 -3.0 70\u201374 -3.0 -3.0 -2.5 75 or older -3.0 -2.5 -2.5 a Treatment with raloxifene is not recommended. If a woman aged 75 years or older who has one or more independent clinical risk factors for fracture or indicators of low BMD has not previously had her BMD measured, a DXA scan may not be required if the responsible clinician considers it to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible.For the purposes of this guidance, indicators of low BMD are low body mass index (defined as less than 22 kg/m2), medical conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn s disease, conditions that result in prolonged immobility, and untreated premature menopause. Rheumatoid arthritis is also a medical condition indicative of low BMD.Teriparatide is recommended as an alternative treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women: who are unable to take alendronate and risedronate, or have a contraindication to or are intolerant of alendronate and either risedronate or etidronate (as defined in intolerance below), or who have had an unsatisfactory response (as defined in unsatisfactory response below) to treatment with alendronate or risedronate and who are 65 years or older and have a T-score of \u20134.0 SD or below, or a T-score of \u20133.5 SD or below plus more than two fractures, or who are aged 55\u201364 years and have a T-score of  \u20134 SD or below plus more than two fractures.Independent clinical risk factorsFor the purposes of this guidance, independent clinical risk factors for fracture are parental history of hip fracture, alcohol intake of 4 or more units per day, and rheumatoid arthritis.IntoleranceFor the purposes of this guidance, intolerance of alendronate or risedronate is defined as persistent upper gastrointestinal disturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant discontinuation of treatment, and that occurs even though the instructions for administration have been followed correctly.Unsatisfactory responseFor the purposes of this guidance, an unsatisfactory response is defined as occurring when a woman has another fragility fracture despite adhering fully to treatment for 1 year and there is evidence of a decline in BMD below her pre-treatment baseline.Women currently receiving treatment Women who are currently receiving treatment with one of the drugs covered by this guidance, but for whom treatment would not have been recommended according to this guidance, should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.subhead:DenosumabThe following recommendations are an extract from NICE technology appraisal guidance on denosumab for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. Denosumab is recommended as a treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures only in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures who are unable to comply with the special instructions for administering alendronate and either risedronate or etidronate, or have an intolerance of, or a contraindication to, those treatments.Women currently receiving denosumab for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures who do not meet the criteria specified should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinician consider it appropriate to stop.NICE has written information for the public explaining its guidance on denosumab.For further information, see what NICE says on medicines optimisation.SourcesThe NICE guidance that was used to create this part of the interactive flowchart.
