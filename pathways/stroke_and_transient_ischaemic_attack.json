Spectra Optia is faster to use and needs to be done less often than manual red blood cell exchange. Spectra Optia should be considered for automated red blood cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease who need regular transfusion. NICE recommends collaborative data collection to generate further clinical evidence on some outcomes of treatment with Spectra Optia. In particular, there is a need for long-term data on how automated and manual exchange affect iron overload status and the subsequent need for chelation therapy.Based on current evidence and expert advice on the anticipated benefits of the technology when used in patients with iron overload, cost modelling shows that in most cases using Spectra Optia is cost saving compared with manual red blood cell exchange or top-up transfusion. The savings depend on the iron overload status of the patient, and are more likely to be achieved if devices already owned by the NHS can be used to treat sickle cell disease. The estimated cost saving for adopting Spectra Optia is \u00a318,100 per patient per year, which has the potential to save the NHS in England \u00a312.9 million each year.
